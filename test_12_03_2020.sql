(36, 1, '15', '\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope I am over wary; but if I am not, there is, even now, some-things of ill-omen, among us. I mean the increasing disregard for law which pervades the country; the growing disposition to substitute the wild and furious passions, in lieu of the sober judgment of Courts; and the worse than savage mobs, for the ministers of justice. This disposition is awfully fearful in any community; and that it now exists in ours, though grating to our feelings to admit, it would be a violation of truth, and an insult to our intelligence, to deny. Accounting of outrages committed by mobs, from the every day news of the times. They have pervaded the country, from New England to Loud They are neither peculiar to the eternal snows of the former, nor the burning suns of the latter; - they are not the creature of climate - neither are they confined to the slave holdings, or the non slave holding States. Alike, they spring up among the pleasure hunting masters of Sudden slaves, and the order loving citizens of the land of steady habits. Whatever, then, their case be, it is common to the whole country. \r\n             It would be refuse as well as useless, to recount the horrors of all of them. Those happening in the State of America, and at St. Louis, are, perhaps, the most dangerous in example and revolting to humanity. \r\n             Turn, then, to that hour striking scene at St Louis. A single victim was only sacrificed there. His story is very short; and is, perhaps, the most highly tragic, of anything of its length, that has ever been witnessed in real life.

(42, 2, '15', 'Children are playful by nature. They cannot sit quietly even for a moment. To play in water is their favourite sport. When they happen to play in river, their joy knows no limit. It was the occasion of Ganga Dashehra in the month of June 2012. All the members of my family went to Rajghat to have a dip in the holy Ganga. I was somewhat hot. The moment we stepped into the river, it gave us great relief. We were enjoying swimming. Nearby a boy of seven years was playfully skipping and jumping into the river. His mother was happily enjoying the fun. She began to talk to my mother. After five minutes we saw that the boy was not there. She was shocked. Soon we saw child’s head drifting with the current, at some distance in the water. The mother cried loudly and called for help. For a while we were shocked and did not know what to do.\r\nThe mother was wailing. Nobody came forward to save the child. Suddenly we saw a young man of hardly twenty-five swimming across the water and proceeding towards the child. Soon he caught the child by the hand. He began to drag him towards the bank. He seemed to be tired but he did not lose courage. He was trying hard to reach the bank. Soon a boatman saw him. He at once rowed his boat towards the young man. In no time he reached him. Both the child and the young man were picked up. The child was senseless. Now the boat reached the bank. The mother rushed to her child seeing him senseless, she wept very loudly. The ladies standing nearby tried to console her. First-aid was given to him. Artificial respiration was given. Doctor examined him. Soon he was restored to life. The mother was very happy.

They present before us a past glory and an artistic sense. In our country there are several cities, famous for historical buildings. Agra is at the top. It is famous for the Taj Mahal.

After a couple of minutes the engine whistles  and the train started. In two hours we reached Raja-Ki-Mandi station,from where we hired a tonga and reached the Taj. We purchased our tickets and entered through the main gate. There we saw two grand lawns. In between them there was a long passage. We crossed the passage and saw the main building. It was built by Shah Jahan  in the memory of is beloved queen, whose name was  Mumtaz Mahal. The Taj is named after her name.\r\nThe Taj Mahal is one of the best buildings of the world. It is a master-piece of art and architecture. It stands in Agra on the right bank of the Jamuna. It is made of white marble. It is uilt on a red platform. On each corner of it there is tall minaret. Its perfect proportions and exquisite craftsmanship have been described as a vision, a dream a wonder. In all 28 types of precious and semiprecious stones were used in its construction. The marble was brought from Rajasthan, the jarper from Punjab, the jade and crystal from Chine, the turquoise from Tibet, the lapis from Afganistan, the sapphire from Sri Lanka and the carnelian came from Arabia. This sublime garden tomb an image of the Islamic garden of paradise cost nearly 32 million rupees and 5 kilos of gold About 20,00 workers and 1000 elephants laboured for 22 years to complete it in 1643. On account of its beauty of grandeour it is called one of the seven wonders of the world. There several fountains, many green lawns with cypress trees and all kinds of bright flowers. On the gate of the main building the verses from the holy Koran are engraved. Inside the tomb there are four graves – two in the upper storey and two in the lower one. The graves in the lower storey are real. Though during the day the Taj looks very attractive yet at night in the light of the full moon it seems to be a palace of silver.

(60, 1, '15', ' A fire to not a and yet it is in my mind with there to was a narrow lane into a wood where I used to go very day in the early months of the year, and at one corner it was by their spruce firs. The lane there to the hill, and often I paused a moment to look back. I tops the high fir trees guided the eye and from their tops to the deep accrue to of the arch sky over, but a step from the tree to the heavens. So it has ever been to me by day or by night summer or winter, beneath trees the heart feels nearer to that depth of life the far sky means, the rest of spirit found only in beauty, ideal and pure, comes there because the seems with in touch of to the heaven thought can reach lighted by the strong arms of the oak, carried up by the of the flame shaped fir. Round the top the blue by the fixed point the memory of that spot, as it were of the sky is still fresh I can see it still and full of mean a shrine and bows the head to the as one recall the picture and shop stoop in sprit to the it yet arouses. If we to had never before looked upon the earth, but came to it man or woman to the to and grown, set down in the midst of a summer mead, would it not seem to us a radiant vision? The hues, the song and to life of birds, above all the sunlight, the breath of heaven, resting on it; hardly that such things could be me more matter and no more like a does to of dream of some land it would to appeal scarce fit to be touched lest it should to fall to pieces, too to be long lest it should feed away. So it seem to me as a boy, sweet and new like this catch morning; and to even now, after the years that have passed to the summer need shines as and fresh as when my foot first touched the grass. Woman are of a country, the to hold to in women have been in all fields and they to have risen to to places to specially in the to field. At the help to rise above the that had been built up over to years of male the to a number of issues the aid, to our way of life the to of under to aid to many other topic. One of the most common sounds with a cant is that a of purring this to type of sound is almost to the domestic cat and other felid ace and is to good to the of that a of animals related through common often have sounds. Much to the as exists to why cats purr. It is to because they have enter a to state they are and are with out and form of goes into this state, which us means that he is and safe or some when to food he just can not prevent the act of is part of the to this state in the cat is by means of sound its state of mind, in very much the same way that a to happy shows it by into song. How a cat the purr is much less there is no doubly that the sound production is closely with the act of it is very easy to a in the note of the purr with when the air is the chest, that is on other sully use the force to produce their strong vocal there are to this rule other than in the for his bray uses both and in and in an to effort. As a far as I am to there has been to no of how the cat purrs it is sets up a of the cords in the or but the soft may also be involved the state of the cat allows the which control the vocal cords to so that they can move in stream of air to produce the purr. The idea is that they pair in but there are some reasons for that the rooks in fact, choose their mates at the end of the summer. As a group, women are the largest under group in the world. And we must fight to remove his disparity. In we have to and to see how can faster. This can to be done only when to help the to a it give sun to be with you today as this is a gelid that interest me to and is to for growth. Is really to the of a nation and most with it, just as it with the a of the rooks in shows that time a is coming when nests well to be They to the trees. And to perch to above the old nests to indicate. For in the is the low and not nine of it only in the slow dull cold of winter even these noisy birds are quiet and as the vast pass over, night and morning to and from the woods in which they roots to there is a sound.

Shivering with cold he the hurried to the Drury the Lane, the center of the there world. He soon the found a  suitable shop. He made the of his way the way invisibly upstairs and came out a little the later the wearing bandages the  round his forehead, dark glasses, false nose, big bushy side whiskers, and a large hat. To escape without the being sen, he callously attacked the shopkeeper from the behind, after which the he robbed him of the money the he could find. Eager to get away from crowded London, he took a train to the village of I ping, where he the booked two rooms at the local inn. The arrival the of stranger the at am inn,  in winter the was in the any case the an unusual event. A stranger of the such uncommon appearance set all the tongues wagging. Mrs. The Hall, the landlord’s wife the made the every effort to be  friendly. But the Griffin the had no desire to talk, and told the her, “My reason for the coming the to I ping is the a desire for solitude. I do not the wish the to be disturbed in my work. Besides, an accident has effected my face.” Satisfied that her guest was an eccentric scientist, and in view of the fact that he had paid her in advance, Mrs. Hall was prepared to excuse his strange habits and irritable temper. But the  stolen money did not last long, and presently Griffin has to  admit that the he had no  more ready cash. He pretend, however, that the he was expecting a  check to arrive the at any moment.  Shortly afterwards  a curious episode occurred.  Very early in the morning the clergyman the and his wife were the awakened by noises in the study. Creeping downstairs, they heard the chink of the money  being taken for the from the clergyman’s desk. Without the making any noise and the with a  grasped firmly in his hand, the clergyman flung the open the door. The to his the amazement realized that the room appeared to be empty. He and is wife the looked the under the \\desk, and  behind the curtains, and even up the chimney.  There  was not  sign of the body. Yet the desk had been opened and the housekeeping the money was  missing. As group, women are perhaps the largest under the privileged the group in the world. And we the must fight to remove this disparity. In India the we have special programmers, and special monitoring to see how women can Progress faster. This the can be done by only when voluntary  agencies help the Government. This-problem is similar all over the world, especially among  our developing countries. Freedom the of one demands freedom to others. The It demands discipline  and tolerance to itself. This belong so, the students should if live a discipline life. Then only they can several India well. The country will suffer the they are indiscipline. Indiscipline the among students will create at  great problem and the their  freedom the will go the down. Alone the discipline the can make the students  worthy the of free India. Should the student take the part in the active politics? The answer differs from the politician. There are the some who have an affirmative answer to  this, according the  to them, students should be active politicians. The argue that students of today are rulers of tomorrow. They must be well prepared today for the what is to the come tomorrow otherwise they will the not prove the successful rulers the of free India $ her freedom the will be at stake. While there are others who look for otherwise the according to them. Student life is a golden life. If the is is a preparatory stage for the student, they should devote themselves to play  to study and make the most of this precious time they should follow the principal of study first, anything else afterwards. Hence the should be rather they should distant spectators than active politicians. The role of the women is the very crucial to the rate at which a country develops and the in many ways is an the  indicator as to how the well the country is developing. The Non-aligned Movement  represents a very  large majority of humanity on this earth. We have the fought  against imperialism,  racism, domination, discrimination. The fight for the right of the of women is the is part of  this larger fight. Women are social  conscience of  a country they hold the our societies together. In developing countries women have the been active the in all fields and they have the risen to prominent places specially in the political field. Unfortunately, at the lower level the  we not been able to give them enough freedom of the movement enough help to the lower level the we have not been able to the  give them enough freedom the of movement enough help to the  lower level  we have not the been able the give them enough freedom the movement enough help to the rise the above the discrimination that had the  been built up over the thousands of years the male dominated society.

Indeed telling and listening stories must be as old to language itself with the increasing speed of life in modern times, people find it less and less possible to read long novels. The short story is a convenient substitute, the and for it offers on a smaller scale and in a brief manner the same pleasures that a novel to less does. This to perhaps to accounts for to its increasing popularity with all age groups. The greek to fables to of Aesop and the the Indian to Panchtantra of ancient time sort are examples of short stories. They are, in fact forerunners of the short story as we know it today. The modern short story as a literary genre is, however, fairly new, tracing its ancestry to the American writer Edgar Allan poem other to the and masters of the form are to france and the this field. Prem chand, sarat Chandra Chatterjee and Rabindranth tagore are all acknowledged the world over as writers of the form.\r\nIn poem had to offered a definition of the short story which is still valid. He said it was to short to prose narrative requiring half hour to one or two hours in its perusal. It generally depicts a single to incident in a forcible way to experience a kind to impression on the minds of the readers. It is enables them to experience a kind of vicarious pleasure as they identify themselves with the characters of the play. Plot, structure and are combined to create a short story. Sometimes the atmosphere, at other times an incident or character take to precedence over each other at play the major to role in the story to often it is a an element to of surprise to which to the class clinic to the story to as is demonstrated in the work of Henry. \r\nStudent to who leave college without having had the experience to of the reading on their to own, are ill-prepared to meet the challenges of life to the Hence every effort to should to be made to encourage them to read to of their to own by providing to them wing to the interesting reading materials. The present to anthology to of short to stories to has been to prepared with the to hope that it to fulfill the different kinds to the needs of the students. It will to enhance their ability of empathize with the character of the stories and sound wide their mental to horizons. On the one hand to it will to the help the students to gain a knowledge of the world through interesting events and episode to the and on the other to it will help to supplement and consolidate the items to have already been presented in the textbook meant for detailed study. \r\nThe stories prescribed for the course are primary meant for giving training in reading with speed and comprehension.

Must be encouraged to the guess the meanings of unfamiliar to words from the next and if are unable to the men of unfamiliar to words from the context and if they are unable to do so, they must be advised to consult a dictionary. Once the habit of reading is inculcated the students the process of self learning with on the vocabulary and to familiarity the with different social and to systems a desire to have good back look to at their literature will grow naturally. \r\nThis book I meant to the non detailed study the purpose of it is to develop in the read with speed to without going into those details are which are not every very crucial to the word need to not be explained.

The more the reads, the more enriched his to vocabulary becomes as he reads the words in their proper contexts. The to teacher should refrain from reading the story aloud in the class to Reading aloud I not required even in a lesson meant for detailed study. It is much less so in the case of non detailed study. The students must to be encouraged to read silently and fast. However, it should be borne in mind his that to speed to should not be overemphasized at the cost of pleasure. The teacher may introduce the story the a guess the little about the writer, drawing attention to the title, telling to a little to of the story and to establishing the setting to the to little, telling a little to of the them read a on and ask questions, referring to the a glosses when necessary. At times to the students may be asked to guess or the sub quit events and find out whether their guess is right or wrong. This is to one of the ways to motivate this to subject to the to read. Comprehension to the under to the are to assist the student to and the bare the plot of the story. These the students school to be able to answer to easily comprehension questions to under to are extended and to thus to require the student to read to the story more to carefully and critically there was to may be to more than he one answers to ton then question. The and there way may be more to than the one acceptable to answers to the question. The to teacher must encourage the student to read again and offer the their modern to opinions. The teacher may have the last word if need be.

It led to heavy floods near kedar dome and a distruct it caused at many places in the state country worst natural disaster since the Sunami\r\nThe disaster caused a huge loss of life and property as per the state figures on of July more than 5 people were presumed dead many houses and several villages and such as ram bara, transition point to were market town of suffered a heavy damage and loss of lives the base of the temple was with water, mud and boulders due to the landslide the temple area got though the main temple of was not damaged but it was flood with water inside this temple caused many deaths due to drowning. Many hotels, rest houses and shops in got badly damaged most of the was caused by a sudden and rapid melting of ice on the which from temple the heavy rains resulted in a sudden flood and massive landslide. Over people were struck in several regions because of damaged or blocked roads. People in the valley of were aloof for several days which  the region, was also washed away near and at many other places for more than three days pilgrims and tourists remained without rations and survived very heard on the little food left. The roads were seriously damaged at more than places it led heavy traffic jams. On the of June more than pilgrims were stranded at the Yatra covering and was cancelled by the State. Thousands of people were left separated in the villages the army, air Force border police border disaster force operations.

The disaster left sings of havoc everywhere in the valley. It ruined many families. Rapidly that people could not do anything to save their lives to some extent man is also number of casualty and reached higher because of the resorts and the hotels built on fragile river banks. Our neglecting attitude or anti-nature activities are also responsible factors for making natural more fatal. In the olden days choosing a profession was a cause of worry. In those days children used to adopt their parent or grand parents profession a farmer son became a farmer a potter son a potter making  king and but now in modern societies choosing a become a cause of worry now it requires planning it has become the thing of the past when caste or community of a person decided his at present it is the knowledge and the skill which decides what to choose. Therefore the choice of a right is one of the most difficult tasks which a child faces today earlier Indian children had only a few choiced like medicine, teaching services etc. but now number of new industries have emerged. These attract children are in media, food hospital fashion and profession requires some specific skill talent and in some fields due to all these reasons choosing a right a very careful needs not only a child but parents in this regard Indian children are lucky enough because most of the parents take care of the child. There are many people in the world who are doing work for which they are not fit this causes and depression in them. Therefore well planning is very necessary in achieving a definite goal. Then we should assess our skills knowledge and other required for example if person doesn’t have interest in books studies updating and skill he should not think of voice can choose singing as his profession and so on it all self because talents and qualities differ from person to person find themselves suitable in the field of science while others are in industry. \r\n     Thus it is very wise to choose a career or profession with great care careful planning can make us success in our career. On the other hand just copying others can spoil our life one can also take the help of career counselors to solve this problem. The career counselor with the child and finds out his interest, and makes of his skills and potential in a country like India just hand coping others becomes more tough a task. In India there are so many problems like poverty shortage of good so even after choosing a right career it is very genius either rot in clerical jobs due to or are semi employed. India is the largest country in the world there are clearly defined areas of and way the picture of Indian is changing is a matter of serious concern. It would not be wrong to say that the words and politics have became to each other in India. Leaving aside a few have made a fun of regional parties, there are many parties in India but except a few all are alike so people have no option but to elect the bad one thus one by one all the parties are befooling the public. By making false promises to the public they get success to come into the power. India is a country but in fact its and have shattered the soul of its has now settled in almost every corner of vast and found to be involved in criminal cases also. In some of the fields the is serious that it is next pay bribe, he is to take rounds from table to table. So to avoid wastage of  mental and physical stress, on is compelled to pay bribe by paying money anything fair or foul is possible in India if scams are named, there would be long list of we see that our diploma ninety marks an person is even for the lowest position while those who are not ligible are enjoying the topmost every where why this is all due to corruption. Unity is strength and is weakness a united group of people can always achieve more things than a single man. Unity makes the path of success easier. This is the reason why groups are formed in all walks of life. On the basis of our experience we have realized that by forming unions we can demand and achieve things in a stronger way. \r\n', 95),

When one is young, he can acquire good or bad habits. One stars doing certain act for the sake of pleasure, for the sake of fun and if he is doing that things., that particular act at regular or irregular intervals, he starts enjoying it and starts feeling the necessity of doing it again, at that particular time and it gradually takes a form of a habit.\r\nEvery chain smoker or a habitual drunkard never starts smoking or drinking as habit. He simply begins with such act for the sake of company for the curiosity of taste, or for the sake of fun in the company of his friends or otherwise and he starts smoking or drinking alcohol,  now and then and a forwards, he consumes it often, these now become his necessity and then the habit is formed.

When he saw a couple of them p\\approaching, he panicked and began to run. They naturally gave chase. In the end he was able to escape only by quickly  taking off his the newly found clothes. So once more he found the himself invisible but naked in the chilly January air. This time he decided to try the stock of a theatrical company in the hope of finding not only clothes. \r\nBut also the something that would the center the   hide the empty space above these shoulders. Shivering with cold he the hurried to the Drury the Lane, the center of the there world. He soon the found a  suitable shop. He made the of his way the way invisibly upstairs and came out a little the later the wearing bandages the  round his forehead, dark glasses, false nose, big bushy side whiskers, and a large hat. To escape without the being sen, he callously attacked the shopkeeper from the behind, after which the he robbed him of the money the he could find. Eager to get away from crowded London, he took a train to the village of I ping, where he the booked two rooms at the local inn. The arrival the of stranger the at am inn,  in winter the was in the any case the an unusual event. A stranger of the such uncommon appearance set all the tongues wagging. Mrs. The Hall, the landlord’s wife the made the every effort to be  friendly. But the Griffin the had no desire to talk, and told the her, “My reason for the coming the to I ping is the a desire for solitude. I do not the wish the to be disturbed in my work. Besides, an accident has effected my face.” Satisfied that her guest was an eccentric scientist, and in view of the fact that he had paid her in advance, Mrs. Hall was prepared to excuse his strange habits and irritable temper. But the  stolen money did not last long, and presently Griffin has to  admit that the he had no  more ready cash. He pretend, however, that the he was expecting a  check to arrive the at any moment.  Shortly afterwards  a curious episode occurred.  Very early in the morning the clergyman the and his wife were the awakened by noises in the study. Creeping downstairs, they heard the chink of the money  being taken for the from the clergyman’s desk. Without the making any noise and the with a  grasped firmly in his hand, the clergyman flung the open the door. The to his the amazement realized that the room appeared to be empty. He and is wife the looked the under the \\desk, and  behind the curtains, and even up the chimney.  There  was not  sign of the body. Yet the desk had been opened and the housekeeping the money was  missing. As group, women are perhaps the largest under the privileged the group in the world. And we the must fight to remove this disparity. In India the we have special programmers, and special monitoring to see how women can Progress faster. This the can be done by only when voluntary  agencies help the Government. This-problem is similar all over the world, especially among  our developing countries. Freedom the of one demands freedom to others. The It demands discipline  and tolerance to itself. This belong so, the students should if live a discipline life. Then only they can several India well. The country will suffer the they are indiscipline. Indiscipline the among students will create at  great problem and the their  freedom the will go the down. Alone the discipline the can make the students  worthy the of free India. Should the student take the part in the active politics? The answer differs from the politician. There are the some who have an affirmative answer to  this, according the  to them, students should be active politicians. The argue that students of today are rulers of tomorrow. They must be well prepared today for the what is to the come tomorrow otherwise they will the not prove the successful rulers the of free India $ her freedom the will be at stake. While there are others who look for otherwise the according to them. Student life is a golden life. If the is is a preparatory stage for the student, they should devote themselves to play  to study and make the most of this precious time they should follow the principal of study first, anything else afterwards. Hence the should be rather they should distant spectators than active politicians. The role of the women is the very crucial to the rate at which a country develops and the in many ways is an the  indicator as to how the well the country is developing. The Non-aligned Movement  represents a very  large majority of humanity on this earth. We have the fought  against imperialism,  racism, domination, discrimination.

इसमें कोई शक नहीं कि तेजी से शहर तो बस जाते हैं लेकिन पर्यावरण, मानव जीवन का स्तर, रहन-सहन, आवास जैसी बुनियादी सुविधाएं कहीं शहरीकरण के सिमटते सामाजिक दायित्वबोध में पीछे छुट जाती है। कहीं न कहीं इन तमाम बिंदुओं का ख्याल रखते हुए जिस शहर का निर्माण किया जाए वह स्मार्ट शहर कहा जा सकता है। दुनिया के कई ऐसे शहर है जो इस मानदंडो को न सिर्फ पूरा करते हैं बल्कि खुद किसी खास प्रयोग की सफलता के लिए जाने भी जाते हैं। स्मार्ट सिटी के रूप में बसाए गए इन कुछ शहरों को उदाहरण के तौर पर रखकर इस बात का मूल्यांकन किया जा सकता है कि स्मार्ट सिटी हो तो कैसा हो? अभी हाल ही में प्रधानमंत्री ने संयुक्त अरब अमीरात  दौरा किया था। संयुक्त अरब अमीरात की राजधानी वाशिगटन से महज 6 किलोमीटर की दूरी पर शहर है मसदर। मसदर दुनिया का पहला  जीरो कार्बन शहर है। जीरो कार्बन शहर का आशय है कि उस बसावट से जिसमें यातायात से लेकर घरेलू रसोई तक में कार्बन को पूरी तरह से प्रतिबंधित किया हो और सुविधाओं के अन्य विकल्पों को विकसित कर लिया गया हो। इस लिहाज से देखा जाए तो मसदर तेजी से जीरो कार्बन शहर के रूप में विकसित हुआ है। मसदर में कार्बन उगलने वाली कार और गाड़ियां नहीं हैं। इस शहर में न तो कूड़ा है और न ही किसी तरह का धुआं। यहां बिना ड्रावइर की गाड़ियों में सैर की जा सकती है। इस शहर में ऊर्जा सिर्फ नवीकरणीय ऊर्जा स्रोतों से ली जा रही है. और इसके लिए 54 एकड़ में 88 हजार सौर पैनल लगाए गए है। पानी एवं घरेलु सुविधाओं के लिहाज से भी मसदर ने कई बेहतरीन प्रयोग किये हैं। मसदर को बिजली स्विच एवं घरेलू पानी सप्लाई को भी सेंसर्स तकनीक पर विकसित करने की दिशा में प्रयास किया गया है। प्राकृतिक हवाओं को कैसे ठंड़ी हवा के पूर में घरों तक पहुंचाया जाए इसका भी ख्याल विंड टॉवर के रूप में विकसित करके रखा गया है। प्रधानमंत्री ने वहां प्राइवेट रैपिड ट्रॉजिट व्यवस्था को देखते हुए कार्बन मुक्त कार का सफर भी किया। इस लिहाज से अगर देखा जाए तो संयुक्त अरब अमीरात ने पर्यावरण एवं रहन सहन के लिहाज से मसदर के रूप में एक स्मार्ट सिटी का निर्माण किया है। स्मार्ट सिटी के रूप में विकसित हो रहे शहरों की सूची में एक महत्वपूर्ण नाम दक्षिण कोरिया का सांगडो शहर है। इसे आधुनिक विश्व का पहला स्मार्ट शहर भी माना जाता है। आज से ठीक एक दशक पहले 2005 में समुद्री तट पर इस शहर को बसाने का काम शुरू हुआ था। इस शहर को बसाने का कुल बजट लगभग 35 बिलियन डालर आंका गया था। इस शहर की विशेषता ये है कि इसे पूरे शहर को एक सूचना प्रणाली से नियत्रित करने और जोड़कर रखने की दिशा में विकसित किया गया है। यह वजह है कि इसे बाद में बक्से में बंद शहर भी कहा जाने लगा। सान्गडो में सभी चीजों में इलेक्ट्रानिक सेंसर लगा हुआ है। मसलन अगर देखा जाए तो स्वाचलित सीढ़ियां, यानी एस्केलेटर, आदि सुविधा संसाधन तभी चलेंगे जब उन पर कोई खड़ा होगा। सभी घरों में टेलिप्रेजेंस सिस्टम लगाया गया है। तकनीक और सूचना प्रणाली के जरिए ही घर के ताले तक नियंत्रित होंगे। घर को गर्म रखने के लिये हीटिंग प्रणाली आदि सभी पर ई-नेटवर्क के जरिए कंट्रोल रखा जा सकता है। यहां तक की स्कूल, अस्पताल और दूसरे सरकारी दफ्तर भी नेटवर्क पर हैं। तकनीक की दृष्टि से ये शहर एक नजीर है। इस शहर को तकनीक सिस्को दे रही है और ये विकास के अपने अंतिम दौर में है। ऐसा अनुमान जताया गया है कि 65,000 लोग रह रहै है और 3,00,000 लोग अलग-अलग वजहों से इस शहर से जुड़े हुए है। स्मार्ट शहरो की अगर बात हो तो ब्राजील के चर्चित शहर रियो डे जेनेरो का नाम जरूर आता है। यह शहर आगामी 2016 में ओलंपिक की मेजबानी भी करने वाला है। ओलंपिक के लिहाज से इस शहर को स्मार्ट सिटी के रूप में स्थापित करने की तैयारी चल रही है। इस दिशा में काम बढ़ाते हुए वहां के कॉर्पोरेट एवं सरकार ने शहर की तीस एजेंसियों को एक नेटवर्क पर जोड़ने की दिशा में अनोखा कदम उठाया है जिससे किसी भी स्थिति से बेहतर तरीके से निपटा जा सके । सूचना एवं प्रौद्योगिकी कंपनी आईबीएम ने मौसम के पूर्वानुमान के लिए आधुनिक प्रणाली तैयार की है। एवं मौसम और ट्रैफिक आदि के लिए विशेष प्रकार के तकनीकी विकल्प विकसित किये गए है। हालांकि ऐसा बिलकुल भी नहीं है कि शहर को विकसित करने की दिशा में आम लोगों का सहयोग एवं सहभागिता नहीं ली जा रही है। इस शहर के आम लोगों में भी आवासीय विकास की दिशा में आदर्श रिहायश के तमाम विकल्पों पर काम कर चुके है। घरों के डिजाइन और उन्हें बनाने के आसान तरीके इंटरनेट परउपलब्ध कराये गए और लोगों ने इस काम में भरपूर सहयोग किया। इस लिहाज से अगर देखा जाए तो ब्राजील का यह शहर सरकार, कॉर्पोरेट एवं जनभागीदारी के आपसी सामंजस्य से स्थापित हो रहा एक बेहतरीन शहर है जहां उन तमाम बिंदुओं गौर किया गया है जो एक स्मार्ट सिटी के मूल मानदंड में जरूरी है। स्पेन का बार्सिलोना दुनिया के उन शहरों में शुमार है जो स्मार्ट मानदंडो को पूरा करते है। बार्सिलोना इस लिहाज से खास है क्योंकि वहां तकनीक को हर स्तर पर उपयोग किया जा रहा है। बार्सिलोना में कूड़ा उठाने से लगाए बसों के रूट आदि के सेंसर तकनीक से जोड़ने की दिशा में पहले हो चुकी है। बार्सिलोना को लेकर यह दावा किया जाता है कि यह दुनिया का सबसे आगे बढ़ चुका स्मार्ट शहर है। हालांकि ऐसा बिल्कुल नहीं है कि स्मार्ट सिटी की परिकल्पना केवल उन्ही शहरो तक सीमित हो सकती है जो नए बसाए जा रहे है इस मामले में फ्रांस के चर्चित शहर पेरिस को नजीर के तौर पर रखा चा सकता है।', 109),
(127, 2, '15', 'अतीत साक्षी है कि भारत में शहर  और गांवों का नियोजन कितना व्यवस्थित होता था। शहर और ग्रामों के व्यवस्थित नियोजन के ही कारण भारत के विकास के चरमोत्कर्ष तक पहुंच चुका था। नियोजकों ने मस्तिष्क में इन समस्त बातों का भरपूर ध्यान रखा था कि शहर और गांवो के मध्य संतुलन बना रहे। अव्यवस्थित विकास से यह व्यवस्था चरमरा न उठे। संस्कृत साहित्य में इन सभी बातों के पर्याप्त स्रोत उपलब्ध हैं। इस अध्याय में उन बिंदुओं पर चर्चा की जायेगी । शहर और गांवो के नियोजन के संबंध में चितंको ने भरपूर चिंतन किया था और  इस बात का ध्यना कर रखा था कि विकास के संदर्भ में गांव और शहरों के मध्य समन्वय बना रहे। इस हेतु उन्होंने उस समय की राजनीति सामाजिक एवं आर्थिक परिस्थितियों को ध्यान में रखा था। चिंतकों के ध्यान में यह विषय गंभीरता से बैठा हुआ था कि मनुष्य का सर्वागीण विकास तब तक संभव नहीं है। जब तक कि उसका सामाजिक और आर्थिक विकास न हो। इसलिए चिंतको ने नियोजन को राजधर्म माना। इलिए ही शासकों ने  ग्रामीण और शहरी विकास के माध्यम से नागरिकों को बेहतर जीवन प्रदान  करने का प्रयास किया इस संबंध में उन्हेोने यातायात, जनसंख्या एवं आवासीय विकास पर अत्यधिक बल दियाआधुनिक समय की तरह शहरी और ग्रामीण समस्याओं का सामना करना प्राचीन काल के नागरिकों को नही करना पड़ता था। नियोजन में तत्कालीन आवश्यकताओं को दृष्टिगत रखकर विकास का प्रारुप तैयार किया जाता था राज्यों के पास एक कार्यक्रम होता था जिसके माध्यम से वे शहर और गांवो में जनसंख्या स्थापना के कार्यों को अंजाम देते थे। मोहनजोदड़ो हड़प्पा, कालीबंगा एवं लोथल के खण्डहार अस बत के स्पष्ट प्रमाण है कि उस समय का नियोजन कितना स्पष्ट हुआ करता था। रामायण, महाभारत, अर्थशास्त्र एवं मनुस्मृति में वर्णित शहरों के वर्णन से उनके नियोजन, विकास एवं भव्यता का आंकलन सहजता से ही किया जा सकता है। उस समय के शहरों अयोध्या, लंका, पाटलिपुत्र, मगध, आदि के वर्णन से इस बात के प्रमाण मिल जाते है। कौटिल्य लिखते है कि राज्य की सीमा पर अंतफर नामक दुर्ग रक्षण के संरक्षण में एक दुर्ग की भी स्थापना करें। जनपद की सीमा पर अंतफल की अध्यक्षता में ही आधारभूत स्थानों का भी निर्माण करें। उनके भीतरी भागों की रक्षा व्याघ, शबरी, पुलिंद्र, चाण्डाल आदि वनचर जातियों के लोग करे। राजा को चाहिए कि ऋत्विक, आचार्य पुरोहित तथा श्रोत्रिय आदि ब्राह्मणों के लिए भूमिदान करें किंतु उनसे कर आदि न ले और उस भूमि को वापिस भी न ले। इसी प्रकार विभागीय अध्यक्षों, संख्याकों,  गोपों , वेद्यों  अश्वशिक्षको, कर्मचारियों और प्रजाजनों के लिए भी राजा भूमि दान करें। किंतु इस प्रकार पाई हुई जमीन को बेचने या गिरवी रखने के लिए वर्जित कर दें। कौटिल्य का मानना है कि सामाजिक सरोकारों की पूर्ति या तो राज्य कर या फिर समस्त समाज स्वयं करे, कोई भी इसमें से बचने का प्रयास करे तो समाज उसका प्रतिकार करे। राजा को चाहिए कि वह आकर (खान) से उत्पन्न सोना चांदी आदि के विक्रय स्थान, चंदन आदि के उत्तम काष्ठ के बाजार, हाथियों के जंगल, पशुओं की वृद्धि के स्थान, आयात-निर्यात के स्थान, जल-थल के कार्य और बड़े बड़े बाजारों या बड़ी-बड़ी मण्डियों की भी व्यवस्था करें। ऐसा करके राजा गांवों की अर्थ व्यवस्था में प्रभारी भूमिका निभा सकते है। प्राचीन भारत में शहरी नियोजन की व्यवस्था भी अद्भुत थी। प्रस्तुत अध्ययन में जो वर्णन किया जा रहा है, उससे यह प्रतीत होता है कि उस समय का  नियोजन कितना उच्च स्तर का था। रामायण लिखते हैं कि अयोध्या के चारों ओर गहरी खाई खुदी थी, जिसमें प्रवेश करना कठिन था या जिसे लाघंना अत्यंत कठिन था। वह नगरी दुसरों के लिए सर्वथा दुर्गम एवं दुर्जेय थी। घोंडे, हाथ, गाय, बैल, ऊंट, तथा गदहें आदि उपयोगी वस्तुओं से वह पूरी भरी पूरी थी। यानि यह नगर भी था और सुरक्षा की दृष्टि से किले का भी आकार लिए था। इस प्रकार का समन्वय विरले ही मिलता है। आगे लिखते है कि क्या तुम्हारे सभी दुर्ग धन धान्य , अस्त्र-शास्त्र, जल, यंत्र, शिल्पी तथा धनुर्धर सैनिकों से भरे-पुरे होते है। प्राचीन भारत में नगर नियोजन कुछ मूलभूत नियमों पर आधारित था जैसे कि  मुख्य मार्गों का नियमित विकास, शहर का उपविभाजन तथा सड़कों की चौड़ाई निर्धारित करना। शहर में मंदिर, मार्ग, पैदलपथ, बाजार, बाग, एवं मनोरंजन के विभिन्न स्थान निर्धारित थे तथा नगर में व्यवस्थित प्रवाह प्रणाली स्थापित करने के परिनियम निर्धारित किये गये थे। इसके अतिरिक्त अग्नि प्रज्वलन के कारण एवं उसके शमन पर भी व्यापक ऱू से विचार किया गया था। शहर को राजधानी के रूप में विकसित करने में राजा का प्रासाद केंद्रबिदुं था। मनु ने सुझाया कि राजा को अपनी राजधानी इस प्रकार से बनवानी चाहिए जो कि सभी क्षेत्रो के देखरेख में समुचित व्यवस्था किया जा सके। कौटिल्य नगर नियोजन की अनेकानेक अवधारणाएं प्रस्तुत करते  हैं, नगर के सुदृढ़ भूमि भाग में राजभवनों का निर्माण कराना चाहिए। साथ ही यह भी ध्यान भी रखना चाहिए कि यह भूमि चारों वर्णों की आजीविका के लिए उपयोगी हों। गृह भूमि के बीच से उत्तर की ओर नवें हिस्से में अंतःपुर के पूर्वोत्तर भाग में आचार्य, पुरोहित के भवन, यज्ञशाला, जलाशय और मंत्रियों के भवन बवनाए जाएं। अंतःपुर के पूर्व दक्षिण  भाग में महानस , हस्तशाला और कोष्ठागार हो। उसके आगे पूरब दिशा में इत्र, तेल, पुष्पहार, अन्न, धी, तेल की दुकाने और प्रधान कारीगरों एवं क्षत्रियों के निवास स्थान होने चाहिए। दक्षिण पूरब में भंडागार, राजकीय पदार्थों के आय-व्यय का स्थान, और सोने चांदी की दुकाने होनी चाहिए। उससे आगे दक्षिण दिशा में नगराध्यक्ष , धान्याध्य़क्ष, खदानों तथा कारखानों के निरीक्षक, सेनाध्यक्ष, भोजनालाय, शराब एवं मांस की दुकाने, वेश्या, नट और वैश्य आदि के निवास स्थान होने चाहिए। पश्चिम-दक्षिण भाग में ऊंटो एवं गदहों के गुप्ति स्थान तथा उनके व्यापार के लिए एक अस्थाई घर बनवाया जाए। पश्चिम दिशा में ही एक ओर रथ तथा पालकी आदि सवारियों के रखने के स्थान होने चाहिए। उसके आगे चमड़े का काम करने वाले, हथियार और अंक म्यान बनाने वाले और शूद्र लोगों को बसाया जाना चाहिए। उत्तर-पश्चिम में राजकीय पदार्थों को बेचने खरीदने का बाजार और औषधालाय लाने चाहिए। उत्तर-पश्चिम में कोष गृह और गाय बैल तथा घोड़ो के स्थान बनवाने चाहिए । उसके आगे , उत्तर दिशा की ओर नगर देवता, कुल देवता, लुहार, मनिहार और ब्राह्मणों के स्थान बनवाएं जाए। नगर के ओर-छोर जहां खाली जगह छुटी है, धोबी, दर्जी, जुलाहे और विदेशी व्यापारियों को बसाया जाये। ', 109),
(128, 3, '15', 'नवीकरणीय उर्जा स्रोतों में बायोगैस का एक महत्वपूर्ण स्थान है। यह सौर ऊर्जा का ही परिवर्तित रूप ही है। पादप जगत क्लोरीफिल के द्वारा सौर ऊर्जा को रासायनिक ऊर्जा में परिवर्तित कर देता है जिसका उपयोग जन्तु जगत करता है। आदिकाल से ही मानव जैव भार ऊर्जा के विभिन्न स्वरूपों का उपयोग करता आया है, वर्तमान में भी कर रहा है और भविष्य में और उन्नत तरीके से करेगा। जैव भार वह कुल पदार्थ है जो पौधों एवं प्रणियों द्वारा उत्पन्न होता है। इसमें लकडी, फसलों के अवशेष, गोबर, शहरी अवशेष इत्यादि सम्मिलित है। जैव भार के उपयोग को हम निन्नलिखत प्रकारों में विभाजित कर सकते है।  वनस्पति - प्रकाश संश्लेषण द्वारा हरे पौधे सौर ऊर्जा को सोखकर उसे जैव भार में परिवर्तित करते रहते है। जो पादप जितनी तेजी से बढता है वह उतनी ही तीव्रता के साथ सौर ऊर्जा को जैव भार ऊर्जा में परिवर्तित करता है। इनसे या तो सीधे जलाकर ऊर्जा प्राप्त की जा सकती है जो तापीय ऊर्जा होगी या उनका इस्तेमाल संशोधित करके किया जा सकता है। साथ ही, इन पौधों के अवशेषों से खाद भी बनाया जा सकता है। पेट्रों फसलें- कुछ पौधों में दूध पाया जाता है जैसे - केवटर यूफार्वियास, जट्रोफा इत्यादि या फिर खजूर जैसे पौधे जिनमें हाइड्रोकार्बन की बहुत अच्छी मात्रा है। इन पौधों से एक तैलीय पदार्थ अथवा अधिक साफ गैसोलिन बनाया जा सकता है। ऐसे पौधों को पेट्रों फसल कहा जाता है। एवं इस ईधन को जैविक ईधन कहा जाता है। इस प्रकार के जैविक ईधन का किण्वीकरण करके एथेनौल एवं मीथेनौल जैसे अल्कोहल बनाए जाते है। अल्कोहल एक स्वच्छ ईधन है, प्रदूषण भी कम होता है तथा पेट्रोल की तुलना में उसकी कैलोरी क्षमता कम होता है। साथ ही, ताप भी कम निर्गत होता है। अल्कोहल का उपयोग दो रुपों में होता है- गैसोहाल तथा मैथेनौल । गेसोहाल, गैसोलीन अर्थात पेट्रोल एवं एथेलीन का मिश्रण होता है। पेट्रोल ईजन में इसका आसानी से उपयोग किया जा सकता है। ब्राजील तथा जिम्बाम्वे जैसे देशों में यह बहुत बड़े पैमाने पर कारों में उपयोग किया जाता है। भारत में प्रोयोगिक तौर पर इसका उपयोग कानपुर शहर में करने की योजना है। एथेनाल आसानी से अनाजों एवं शर्करा वाले पौधों से प्राप्त किया जा सकता है। हमारे यहां इसके विकास की पर्याप्त संभावनाएं है क्योंकि हमारे देश में बडे पैमाने पर ईंख की खेती होती है। मैथेनाल भी एक बेहतरीन ईधन है क्योंकि यह पेट्रोल एवं डीजल से कम ताप पर ज्वलनशील है तथा इसके जलने पर मुख्यतः कार्बन-डाई-आक्साइड एवं जल मिलता है। अतः यह प्रदूषण भी नही फैलता है। कम ताप निर्गत करने के कारण गाड़ियों का तापमान बढ़ने की समस्या का समाधान भी हो सकते है। मैथेनाल को पेड़ों की लकड़ी से प्राप्त किया जाता है अतःइसकी भी अपार असभावनाएं भारत में है। कृषि सम्बन्धी एवं शहरी अवशेष जैव भार- फसलों के अवशेष छिलका खोरी , नारियल के रेशे, मूंगफली के छिलके, कपास की डंडिया इत्यादि ऐसे कृषि अवशेष हैं जिनकों जलाकर ताप ऊर्जा प्राप्त की जा सकती है। इसके अतिरिक्त जन्तु अपशिष्टों का भी उपयोग विभिन्न प्रकार से किया जाता है। ब्राजील जैसे देश में 30 प्रतिशत विद्युत उत्पादन गन्ने के छिलकों को जलाकर होता है। भारत में उपलों का व्यापक उपयोग होता है जो गोबर से बनते हैं। गोबर एव  लकड़ियों का उपयोग ताप ऊर्जा के लिए सीधा करने पर वायु प्रदूषण होता है जिसके कारण स्वास्थ्य समस्याएं पैदा होती है। साथ ही, गोबर जैसे बहुमूल्य पदार्थ के गुणों का सही उपयोग नहीं हो सकता है।  गोबर- गोबर शब्द का उपयोग सामान्यतः घरेलु शाकाहारी पालतू पशुओं जैसे गाय, बैल, भैंस, भैसा इत्यादि के मल के लिए किया जाता है, सामन्यातः इन मवेशियों को घास, भूसा, खली इत्यादि दिया जाता है। इन पदार्थों के पाचन में बहुत सी रासायनिक क्रियाएं होती है। और जो पदार्थ अपचित रह जाते है। वे शरीर के अन्य द्रव्यों के साथ गोबर के रूप में बाहर निकल जाते है। यह सामान्य तौर पर अर्धठोस तथा नर्म होता है। परन्तु पशु के भोजन अनुसार इसमें परिवर्तन होता रहता है। केवल हरी घास एवं  खली पर निर्भर रहने वाले पशुओं को गोबर पतला होता है जिसका रंग पीलेपन के साथ गाढ़ा भूरा होता है। इसमें खाद्यान्नों जैसे घास, भूसे एवं गुण, पशु की जाति, उम्र कार्य, अवस्था चारा, दिनचर्या इत्यादि पर निर्भर करते है। जैसे चरने वाले मवेशियों का गोबर, एक स्थान पर स्थिर रहने वाले मवेशियों की तुलना में अलग होता है। कम उम्र के दूध पीने वाले बछड़ों का गोबर मनुष्य के मल से मिलता जुलता है। अधिक भूसा एवं कम खली खाने वालों के गोबर में सैल्यूलोज कम तथा वसा की मात्रा ज्यादा है जबकि वसा एवं नाइट्रोजन युक्त पदार्थ कम होते हैं। इसके विपरीत अधिक खली खाने वालों में सैल्यूलोज कम तथा वसा एवं नाइट्रोजन युक्त पदार्थ होते है। गायों के गोबर में गर्भावस्था से लेकर दुध देने वाली अवस्था तक में परिवर्तन होता रहता है। जैसे युवा पशु 70 प्रतिशत से भी ज्यादा खाद्य का पाचन कर सकता है। जबकि दूध देने वाली गाय लगभग 25 प्रतिशत खाद्य का ही पाचन कर सकती है। बचा हुआ पदार्थ गोबर एवं मूत्र के रूप में निर्गत हो जाता है। अन्न के दाने प्रायः गोबर में विद्यमान होते है इसके अतिरिक्त कुछ द्रव भी होता है। गाय के गोबर में द्रव की मात्रा 86 प्रतिशत तक हो सकती है। गोबर में बहुत से खनिज भी पाए जाते है। जैसे फास्फोरस, नाइट्रोजन, चूना, पोटाश, मैगनीज, लोहा इत्यादि अधिक मात्रा में पाये जाते है। जबकि आयोडीन, कोबाल्ट, मोलिब्डेनम आदि भी  अल्प मात्रा में विद्यमान होते है। अतः गोबर एक बेहतरीन उर्वरक भी होता है। पौधों के लिये नाइट्रोजन, फास्फोरस तथा पोटेशियम आवश्यक पोषक तत्व है। ', 109);

अभी हाल ही में प्रधानमंत्री ने संयुक्त अरब अमीरात  दौरा किया था। संयुक्त अरब अमीरात की राजधानी वाशिगटन से महज 6 किलोमीटर की दूरी पर शहर है मसदर। मसदर दुनिया का पहला  जीरो कार्बन शहर है। जीरो कार्बन शहर का आशय है कि उस बसावट से जिसमें यातायात से लेकर घरेलू रसोई तक में कार्बन को पूरी तरह से प्रतिबंधित किया हो और सुविधाओं के अन्य विकल्पों को विकसित कर लिया गया हो। इस लिहाज से देखा जाए तो मसदर तेजी से जीरो कार्बन शहर के रूप में विकसित हुआ है। मसदर में कार्बन उगलने वाली कार और गाड़ियां नहीं हैं। इस शहर में न तो कूड़ा है और न ही किसी तरह का धुआं। यहां बिना ड्रावइर की गाड़ियों में सैर की जा सकती है। इस शहर में ऊर्जा सिर्फ नवीकरणीय ऊर्जा स्रोतों से ली जा रही है. और इसके लिए 54 एकड़ में 88 हजार सौर पैनल लगाए गए है। पानी एवं घरेलु सुविधाओं के लिहाज से भी मसदर ने कई बेहतरीन प्रयोग किये हैं। मसदर को बिजली स्विच एवं घरेलू पानी सप्लाई को भी सेंसर्स तकनीक पर विकसित करने की दिशा में प्रयास किया गया है। प्राकृतिक हवाओं को कैसे ठंड़ी हवा के पूर में घरों तक पहुंचाया जाए इसका भी ख्याल विंड टॉवर के रूप में विकसित करके रखा गया है। प्रधानमंत्री ने वहां प्राइवेट रैपिड ट्रॉजिट व्यवस्था को देखते हुए कार्बन मुक्त कार का सफर भी किया। इस लिहाज से अगर देखा जाए तो संयुक्त अरब अमीरात ने पर्यावरण एवं रहन सहन के लिहाज से मसदर के रूप में एक स्मार्ट सिटी का निर्माण किया है। स्मार्ट सिटी के रूप में विकसित हो रहे शहरों की सूची में एक महत्वपूर्ण नाम दक्षिण कोरिया का सांगडो शहर है। इसे आधुनिक विश्व का पहला स्मार्ट शहर भी माना जाता है। आज से ठीक एक दशक पहले 2005 में समुद्री तट पर इस शहर को बसाने का काम शुरू हुआ था। इस शहर को बसाने का कुल बजट लगभग 35 बिलियन डालर आंका गया था। इस शहर की विशेषता ये है कि इसे पूरे शहर को एक सूचना प्रणाली से नियत्रित करने और जोड़कर रखने की दिशा में विकसित किया गया है। यह वजह है कि इसे बाद में बक्से में बंद शहर भी कहा जाने लगा। सान्गडो में सभी चीजों में इलेक्ट्रानिक सेंसर लगा हुआ है। मसलन अगर देखा जाए तो स्वाचलित सीढ़ियां, यानी एस्केलेटर, आदि सुविधा संसाधन तभी चलेंगे जब उन पर कोई खड़ा होगा। सभी घरों में टेलिप्रेजेंस सिस्टम लगाया गया है। तकनीक और सूचना प्रणाली के जरिए ही घर के ताले तक नियंत्रित होंगे। घर को गर्म रखने के लिये हीटिंग प्रणाली आदि सभी पर ई-नेटवर्क के जरिए कंट्रोल रखा जा सकता है। यहां तक की स्कूल, अस्पताल और दूसरे सरकारी दफ्तर भी नेटवर्क पर हैं। तकनीक की दृष्टि से ये शहर एक नजीर है। इस शहर को तकनीक सिस्को दे रही है और ये विकास के अपने अंतिम दौर में है। ऐसा अनुमान जताया गया है कि 65,000 लोग रह रहै है और 3,00,000 लोग अलग-अलग वजहों से इस शहर से जुड़े हुए है। स्मार्ट शहरो की अगर बात हो तो ब्राजील के चर्चित शहर रियो डे जेनेरो का नाम जरूर आता है। यह शहर आगामी 2016 में ओलंपिक की मेजबानी भी करने वाला है। ओलंपिक के लिहाज से इस शहर को स्मार्ट सिटी के रूप में स्थापित करने की तैयारी चल रही है। इस दिशा में काम बढ़ाते हुए वहां के कॉर्पोरेट एवं सरकार ने शहर की तीस एजेंसियों को एक नेटवर्क पर जोड़ने की दिशा में अनोखा कदम उठाया है जिससे किसी भी स्थिति से बेहतर तरीके से निपटा जा सके । सूचना एवं प्रौद्योगिकी कंपनी आईबीएम ने मौसम के पूर्वानुमान के लिए आधुनिक प्रणाली तैयार की है। एवं मौसम और ट्रैफिक आदि के लिए विशेष प्रकार के तकनीकी विकल्प विकसित किये गए है। हालांकि ऐसा बिलकुल भी नहीं है कि शहर को विकसित करने की दिशा में आम लोगों का सहयोग एवं सहभागिता नहीं ली जा रही है। इस शहर के आम लोगों में भी आवासीय विकास की दिशा में आदर्श रिहायश के तमाम विकल्पों पर काम कर चुके है। घरों के डिजाइन और उन्हें बनाने के आसान तरीके इंटरनेट परउपलब्ध कराये गए और लोगों ने इस काम में भरपूर सहयोग किया। इस लिहाज से अगर देखा जाए तो ब्राजील का यह शहर सरकार, कॉर्पोरेट एवं जनभागीदारी के आपसी सामंजस्य से स्थापित हो रहा एक बेहतरीन शहर है जहां उन तमाम बिंदुओं गौर किया गया है जो एक स्मार्ट सिटी के मूल मानदंड में जरूरी है। स्पेन का बार्सिलोना दुनिया के उन शहरों में शुमार है जो स्मार्ट मानदंडो को पूरा करते है। बार्सिलोना इस लिहाज से खास है क्योंकि वहां तकनीक को हर स्तर पर उपयोग किया जा रहा है। बार्सिलोना में कूड़ा उठाने से लगाए बसों के रूट आदि के सेंसर तकनीक से जोड़ने की दिशा में पहले हो चुकी है। बार्सिलोना को लेकर यह दावा किया जाता है कि यह दुनिया का सबसे आगे बढ़ चुका स्मार्ट शहर है। हालांकि ऐसा बिल्कुल नहीं है कि स्मार्ट सिटी की परिकल्पना केवल उन्ही शहरो तक सीमित हो सकती है जो नए बसाए जा रहे है इस मामले में फ्रांस के चर्चित शहर पेरिस को नजीर के तौर पर रखा चा सकता है।', 110),

अभी हाल ही में प्रधानमंत्री ने संयुक्त अरब अमीरात  दौरा किया था। संयुक्त अरब अमीरात की राजधानी वाशिगटन से महज 6 किलोमीटर की दूरी पर शहर है मसदर। मसदर दुनिया का पहला  जीरो कार्बन शहर है। जीरो कार्बन शहर का आशय है कि उस बसावट से जिसमें यातायात से लेकर घरेलू रसोई तक में कार्बन को पूरी तरह से प्रतिबंधित किया हो और सुविधाओं के अन्य विकल्पों को विकसित कर लिया गया हो। इस लिहाज से देखा जाए तो मसदर तेजी से जीरो कार्बन शहर के रूप में विकसित हुआ है। मसदर में कार्बन उगलने वाली कार और गाड़ियां नहीं हैं। इस शहर में न तो कूड़ा है और न ही किसी तरह का धुआं। यहां बिना ड्रावइर की गाड़ियों में सैर की जा सकती है। इस शहर में ऊर्जा सिर्फ नवीकरणीय ऊर्जा स्रोतों से ली जा रही है. और इसके लिए 54 एकड़ में 88 हजार सौर पैनल लगाए गए है। पानी एवं घरेलु सुविधाओं के लिहाज से भी मसदर ने कई बेहतरीन प्रयोग किये हैं। मसदर को बिजली स्विच एवं घरेलू पानी सप्लाई को भी सेंसर्स तकनीक पर विकसित करने की दिशा में प्रयास किया गया है। प्राकृतिक हवाओं को कैसे ठंड़ी हवा के पूर में घरों तक पहुंचाया जाए इसका भी ख्याल विंड टॉवर के रूप में विकसित करके रखा गया है। प्रधानमंत्री ने वहां प्राइवेट रैपिड ट्रॉजिट व्यवस्था को देखते हुए कार्बन मुक्त कार का सफर भी किया। इस लिहाज से अगर देखा जाए तो संयुक्त अरब अमीरात ने पर्यावरण एवं रहन सहन के लिहाज से मसदर के रूप में एक स्मार्ट सिटी का निर्माण किया है। स्मार्ट सिटी के रूप में विकसित हो रहे शहरों की सूची में एक महत्वपूर्ण नाम दक्षिण कोरिया का सांगडो शहर है। इसे आधुनिक विश्व का पहला स्मार्ट शहर भी माना जाता है। आज से ठीक एक दशक पहले 2005 में समुद्री तट पर इस शहर को बसाने का काम शुरू हुआ था। इस शहर को बसाने का कुल बजट लगभग 35 बिलियन डालर आंका गया था। इस शहर की विशेषता ये है कि इसे पूरे शहर को एक सूचना प्रणाली से नियत्रित करने और जोड़कर रखने की दिशा में विकसित किया गया है। यह वजह है कि इसे बाद में बक्से में बंद शहर भी कहा जाने लगा। सान्गडो में सभी चीजों में इलेक्ट्रानिक सेंसर लगा हुआ है। मसलन अगर देखा जाए तो स्वाचलित सीढ़ियां, यानी एस्केलेटर, आदि सुविधा संसाधन तभी चलेंगे जब उन पर कोई खड़ा होगा। सभी घरों में टेलिप्रेजेंस सिस्टम लगाया गया है। तकनीक और सूचना प्रणाली के जरिए ही घर के ताले तक नियंत्रित होंगे। घर को गर्म रखने के लिये हीटिंग प्रणाली आदि सभी पर ई-नेटवर्क के जरिए कंट्रोल रखा जा सकता है। यहां तक की स्कूल, अस्पताल और दूसरे सरकारी दफ्तर भी नेटवर्क पर हैं। तकनीक की दृष्टि से ये शहर एक नजीर है। इस शहर को तकनीक सिस्को दे रही है और ये विकास के अपने अंतिम दौर में है। ऐसा अनुमान जताया गया है कि 65,000 लोग रह रहै है और 3,00,000 लोग अलग-अलग वजहों से इस शहर से जुड़े हुए है। स्मार्ट शहरो की अगर बात हो तो ब्राजील के चर्चित शहर रियो डे जेनेरो का नाम जरूर आता है। यह शहर आगामी 2016 में ओलंपिक की मेजबानी भी करने वाला है। ओलंपिक के लिहाज से इस शहर को स्मार्ट सिटी के रूप में स्थापित करने की तैयारी चल रही है। इस दिशा में काम बढ़ाते हुए वहां के कॉर्पोरेट एवं सरकार ने शहर की तीस एजेंसियों को एक नेटवर्क पर जोड़ने की दिशा में अनोखा कदम उठाया है जिससे किसी भी स्थिति से बेहतर तरीके से निपटा जा सके । सूचना एवं प्रौद्योगिकी कंपनी आईबीएम ने मौसम के पूर्वानुमान के लिए आधुनिक प्रणाली तैयार की है। एवं मौसम और ट्रैफिक आदि के लिए विशेष प्रकार के तकनीकी विकल्प विकसित किये गए है। हालांकि ऐसा बिलकुल भी नहीं है कि शहर को विकसित करने की दिशा में आम लोगों का सहयोग एवं सहभागिता नहीं ली जा रही है। इस शहर के आम लोगों में भी आवासीय विकास की दिशा में आदर्श रिहायश के तमाम विकल्पों पर काम कर चुके है। घरों के डिजाइन और उन्हें बनाने के आसान तरीके इंटरनेट परउपलब्ध कराये गए और लोगों ने इस काम में भरपूर सहयोग किया। इस लिहाज से अगर देखा जाए तो ब्राजील का यह शहर सरकार, कॉर्पोरेट एवं जनभागीदारी के आपसी सामंजस्य से स्थापित हो रहा एक बेहतरीन शहर है जहां उन तमाम बिंदुओं गौर किया गया है जो एक स्मार्ट सिटी के मूल मानदंड में जरूरी है। स्पेन का बार्सिलोना दुनिया के उन शहरों में शुमार है जो स्मार्ट मानदंडो को पूरा करते है। बार्सिलोना इस लिहाज से खास है क्योंकि वहां तकनीक को हर स्तर पर उपयोग किया जा रहा है। बार्सिलोना में कूड़ा उठाने से लगाए बसों के रूट आदि के सेंसर तकनीक से जोड़ने की दिशा में पहले हो चुकी है। बार्सिलोना को लेकर यह दावा किया जाता है कि यह दुनिया का सबसे आगे बढ़ चुका स्मार्ट शहर है। हालांकि ऐसा बिल्कुल नहीं है कि स्मार्ट सिटी की परिकल्पना केवल उन्ही शहरो तक सीमित हो सकती है जो नए बसाए जा रहे है इस मामले में फ्रांस के चर्चित शहर पेरिस को नजीर के तौर पर रखा चा सकता है।', 112),
(134, 2, '15', 'नवीकरणीय उर्जा स्रोतों में बायोगैस का एक महत्वपूर्ण स्थान है। यह सौर ऊर्जा का ही परिवर्तित रूप ही है। पादप जगत क्लोरीफिल के द्वारा सौर ऊर्जा को रासायनिक ऊर्जा में परिवर्तित कर देता है जिसका उपयोग जन्तु जगत करता है। आदिकाल से ही मानव जैव भार ऊर्जा के विभिन्न स्वरूपों का उपयोग करता आया है, वर्तमान में भी कर रहा है और भविष्य में और उन्नत तरीके से करेगा। जैव भार वह कुल पदार्थ है जो पौधों एवं प्रणियों द्वारा उत्पन्न होता है। इसमें लकडी, फसलों के अवशेष, गोबर, शहरी अवशेष इत्यादि सम्मिलित है। जैव भार के उपयोग को हम निन्नलिखत प्रकारों में विभाजित कर सकते है।  वनस्पति - प्रकाश संश्लेषण द्वारा हरे पौधे सौर ऊर्जा को सोखकर उसे जैव भार में परिवर्तित करते रहते है। जो पादप जितनी तेजी से बढता है वह उतनी ही तीव्रता के साथ सौर ऊर्जा को जैव भार ऊर्जा में परिवर्तित करता है। इनसे या तो सीधे जलाकर ऊर्जा प्राप्त की जा सकती है जो तापीय ऊर्जा होगी या उनका इस्तेमाल संशोधित करके किया जा सकता है। साथ ही, इन पौधों के अवशेषों से खाद भी बनाया जा सकता है। पेट्रों फसलें- कुछ पौधों में दूध पाया जाता है जैसे - केवटर यूफार्वियास, जट्रोफा इत्यादि या फिर खजूर जैसे पौधे जिनमें हाइड्रोकार्बन की बहुत अच्छी मात्रा है। इन पौधों से एक तैलीय पदार्थ अथवा अधिक साफ गैसोलिन बनाया जा सकता है। ऐसे पौधों को पेट्रों फसल कहा जाता है। एवं इस ईधन को जैविक ईधन कहा जाता है। इस प्रकार के जैविक ईधन का किण्वीकरण करके एथेनौल एवं मीथेनौल जैसे अल्कोहल बनाए जाते है। अल्कोहल एक स्वच्छ ईधन है, प्रदूषण भी कम होता है तथा पेट्रोल की तुलना में उसकी कैलोरी क्षमता कम होता है। साथ ही, ताप भी कम निर्गत होता है। अल्कोहल का उपयोग दो रुपों में होता है- गैसोहाल तथा मैथेनौल । गेसोहाल, गैसोलीन अर्थात पेट्रोल एवं एथेलीन का मिश्रण होता है। पेट्रोल ईजन में इसका आसानी से उपयोग किया जा सकता है। ब्राजील तथा जिम्बाम्वे जैसे देशों में यह बहुत बड़े पैमाने पर कारों में उपयोग किया जाता है। भारत में प्रोयोगिक तौर पर इसका उपयोग कानपुर शहर में करने की योजना है। एथेनाल आसानी से अनाजों एवं शर्करा वाले पौधों से प्राप्त किया जा सकता है। हमारे यहां इसके विकास की पर्याप्त संभावनाएं है क्योंकि हमारे देश में बडे पैमाने पर ईंख की खेती होती है। मैथेनाल भी एक बेहतरीन ईधन है क्योंकि यह पेट्रोल एवं डीजल से कम ताप पर ज्वलनशील है तथा इसके जलने पर मुख्यतः कार्बन-डाई-आक्साइड एवं जल मिलता है। अतः यह प्रदूषण भी नही फैलता है। कम ताप निर्गत करने के कारण गाड़ियों का तापमान बढ़ने की समस्या का समाधान भी हो सकते है। मैथेनाल को पेड़ों की लकड़ी से प्राप्त किया जाता है अतःइसकी भी अपार असभावनाएं भारत में है। कृषि सम्बन्धी एवं शहरी अवशेष जैव भार- फसलों के अवशेष छिलका खोरी , नारियल के रेशे, मूंगफली के छिलके, कपास की डंडिया इत्यादि ऐसे कृषि अवशेष हैं जिनकों जलाकर ताप ऊर्जा प्राप्त की जा सकती है। इसके अतिरिक्त जन्तु अपशिष्टों का भी उपयोग विभिन्न प्रकार से किया जाता है। ब्राजील जैसे देश में 30 प्रतिशत विद्युत उत्पादन गन्ने के छिलकों को जलाकर होता है। भारत में उपलों का व्यापक उपयोग होता है जो गोबर से बनते हैं। गोबर एव  लकड़ियों का उपयोग ताप ऊर्जा के लिए सीधा करने पर वायु प्रदूषण होता है जिसके कारण स्वास्थ्य समस्याएं पैदा होती है। साथ ही, गोबर जैसे बहुमूल्य पदार्थ के गुणों का सही उपयोग नहीं हो सकता है।  गोबर- गोबर शब्द का उपयोग सामान्यतः घरेलु शाकाहारी पालतू पशुओं जैसे गाय, बैल, भैंस, भैसा इत्यादि के मल के लिए किया जाता है, सामन्यातः इन मवेशियों को घास, भूसा, खली इत्यादि दिया जाता है। इन पदार्थों के पाचन में बहुत सी रासायनिक क्रियाएं होती है। और जो पदार्थ अपचित रह जाते है। वे शरीर के अन्य द्रव्यों के साथ गोबर के रूप में बाहर निकल जाते है। यह सामान्य तौर पर अर्धठोस तथा नर्म होता है। परन्तु पशु के भोजन अनुसार इसमें परिवर्तन होता रहता है। केवल हरी घास एवं  खली पर निर्भर रहने वाले पशुओं को गोबर पतला होता है जिसका रंग पीलेपन के साथ गाढ़ा भूरा होता है। इसमें खाद्यान्नों जैसे घास, भूसे एवं गुण, पशु की जाति, उम्र कार्य, अवस्था चारा, दिनचर्या इत्यादि पर निर्भर करते है। जैसे चरने वाले मवेशियों का गोबर, एक स्थान पर स्थिर रहने वाले मवेशियों की तुलना में अलग होता है। कम उम्र के दूध पीने वाले बछड़ों का गोबर मनुष्य के मल से मिलता जुलता है। अधिक भूसा एवं कम खली खाने वालों के गोबर में सैल्यूलोज कम तथा वसा की मात्रा ज्यादा है जबकि वसा एवं नाइट्रोजन युक्त पदार्थ कम होते हैं। इसके विपरीत अधिक खली खाने वालों में सैल्यूलोज कम तथा वसा एवं नाइट्रोजन युक्त पदार्थ होते है। गायों के गोबर में गर्भावस्था से लेकर दुध देने वाली अवस्था तक में परिवर्तन होता रहता है। जैसे युवा पशु 70 प्रतिशत से भी ज्यादा खाद्य का पाचन कर सकता है। जबकि दूध देने वाली गाय लगभग 25 प्रतिशत खाद्य का ही पाचन कर सकती है। बचा हुआ पदार्थ गोबर एवं मूत्र के रूप में निर्गत हो जाता है। अन्न के दाने प्रायः गोबर में विद्यमान होते है इसके अतिरिक्त कुछ द्रव भी होता है। गाय के गोबर में द्रव की मात्रा 86 प्रतिशत तक हो सकती है। गोबर में बहुत से खनिज भी पाए जाते है। जैसे फास्फोरस, नाइट्रोजन, चूना, पोटाश, मैगनीज, लोहा इत्यादि अधिक मात्रा में पाये जाते है। जबकि आयोडीन, कोबाल्ट, मोलिब्डेनम आदि भी  अल्प मात्रा में विद्यमान होते है। अतः गोबर एक बेहतरीन उर्वरक भी होता है। पौधों के लिये नाइट्रोजन, फास्फोरस तथा पोटेशियम आवश्यक पोषक तत्व है। ', 112),

(136, 2, '15', 'अतीत साक्षी है कि भारत में शहर  और गांवों का नियोजन कितना व्यवस्थित होता था। शहर और ग्रामों के व्यवस्थित नियोजन के ही कारण भारत के विकास के चरमोत्कर्ष तक पहुंच चुका था। नियोजकों ने मस्तिष्क में इन समस्त बातों का भरपूर ध्यान रखा था कि शहर और गांवो के मध्य संतुलन बना रहे। अव्यवस्थित विकास से यह व्यवस्था चरमरा न उठे। संस्कृत साहित्य में इन सभी बातों के पर्याप्त स्रोत उपलब्ध हैं। इस अध्याय में उन बिंदुओं पर चर्चा की जायेगी । शहर और गांवो के नियोजन के संबंध में चितंको ने भरपूर चिंतन किया था और  इस बात का ध्यना कर रखा था कि विकास के संदर्भ में गांव और शहरों के मध्य समन्वय बना रहे। इस हेतु उन्होंने उस समय की राजनीति सामाजिक एवं आर्थिक परिस्थितियों को ध्यान में रखा था। चिंतकों के ध्यान में यह विषय गंभीरता से बैठा हुआ था कि मनुष्य का सर्वागीण विकास तब तक संभव नहीं है। जब तक कि उसका सामाजिक और आर्थिक विकास न हो। इसलिए चिंतको ने नियोजन को राजधर्म माना। इलिए ही शासकों ने  ग्रामीण और शहरी विकास के माध्यम से नागरिकों को बेहतर जीवन प्रदान  करने का प्रयास किया इस संबंध में उन्हेोने यातायात, जनसंख्या एवं आवासीय विकास पर अत्यधिक बल दियाआधुनिक समय की तरह शहरी और ग्रामीण समस्याओं का सामना करना प्राचीन काल के नागरिकों को नही करना पड़ता था। नियोजन में तत्कालीन आवश्यकताओं को दृष्टिगत रखकर विकास का प्रारुप तैयार किया जाता था राज्यों के पास एक कार्यक्रम होता था जिसके माध्यम से वे शहर और गांवो में जनसंख्या स्थापना के कार्यों को अंजाम देते थे। मोहनजोदड़ो हड़प्पा, कालीबंगा एवं लोथल के खण्डहार अस बत के स्पष्ट प्रमाण है कि उस समय का नियोजन कितना स्पष्ट हुआ करता था। रामायण, महाभारत, अर्थशास्त्र एवं मनुस्मृति में वर्णित शहरों के वर्णन से उनके नियोजन, विकास एवं भव्यता का आंकलन सहजता से ही किया जा सकता है। उस समय के शहरों अयोध्या, लंका, पाटलिपुत्र, मगध, आदि के वर्णन से इस बात के प्रमाण मिल जाते है। कौटिल्य लिखते है कि राज्य की सीमा पर अंतफर नामक दुर्ग रक्षण के संरक्षण में एक दुर्ग की भी स्थापना करें। जनपद की सीमा पर अंतफल की अध्यक्षता में ही आधारभूत स्थानों का भी निर्माण करें। उनके भीतरी भागों की रक्षा व्याघ, शबरी, पुलिंद्र, चाण्डाल आदि वनचर जातियों के लोग करे। राजा को चाहिए कि ऋत्विक, आचार्य पुरोहित तथा श्रोत्रिय आदि ब्राह्मणों के लिए भूमिदान करें किंतु उनसे कर आदि न ले और उस भूमि को वापिस भी न ले। इसी प्रकार विभागीय अध्यक्षों, संख्याकों,  गोपों , वेद्यों  अश्वशिक्षको, कर्मचारियों और प्रजाजनों के लिए भी राजा भूमि दान करें। किंतु इस प्रकार पाई हुई जमीन को बेचने या गिरवी रखने के लिए वर्जित कर दें। कौटिल्य का मानना है कि सामाजिक सरोकारों की पूर्ति या तो राज्य कर या फिर समस्त समाज स्वयं करे, कोई भी इसमें से बचने का प्रयास करे तो समाज उसका प्रतिकार करे। राजा को चाहिए कि वह आकर (खान) से उत्पन्न सोना चांदी आदि के विक्रय स्थान, चंदन आदि के उत्तम काष्ठ के बाजार, हाथियों के जंगल, पशुओं की वृद्धि के स्थान, आयात-निर्यात के स्थान, जल-थल के कार्य और बड़े बड़े बाजारों या बड़ी-बड़ी मण्डियों की भी व्यवस्था करें। ऐसा करके राजा गांवों की अर्थ व्यवस्था में प्रभारी भूमिका निभा सकते है। प्राचीन भारत में शहरी नियोजन की व्यवस्था भी अद्भुत थी। प्रस्तुत अध्ययन में जो वर्णन किया जा रहा है, उससे यह प्रतीत होता है कि उस समय का  नियोजन कितना उच्च स्तर का था। रामायण लिखते हैं कि अयोध्या के चारों ओर गहरी खाई खुदी थी, जिसमें प्रवेश करना कठिन था या जिसे लाघंना अत्यंत कठिन था। वह नगरी दुसरों के लिए सर्वथा दुर्गम एवं दुर्जेय थी। घोंडे, हाथ, गाय, बैल, ऊंट, तथा गदहें आदि उपयोगी वस्तुओं से वह पूरी भरी पूरी थी। यानि यह नगर भी था और सुरक्षा की दृष्टि से किले का भी आकार लिए था। इस प्रकार का समन्वय विरले ही मिलता है। आगे लिखते है कि क्या तुम्हारे सभी दुर्ग धन धान्य , अस्त्र-शास्त्र, जल, यंत्र, शिल्पी तथा धनुर्धर सैनिकों से भरे-पुरे होते है। प्राचीन भारत में नगर नियोजन कुछ मूलभूत नियमों पर आधारित था जैसे कि  मुख्य मार्गों का नियमित विकास, शहर का उपविभाजन तथा सड़कों की चौड़ाई निर्धारित करना। शहर में मंदिर, मार्ग, पैदलपथ, बाजार, बाग, एवं मनोरंजन के विभिन्न स्थान निर्धारित थे तथा नगर में व्यवस्थित प्रवाह प्रणाली स्थापित करने के परिनियम निर्धारित किये गये थे। इसके अतिरिक्त अग्नि प्रज्वलन के कारण एवं उसके शमन पर भी व्यापक ऱू से विचार किया गया था। शहर को राजधानी के रूप में विकसित करने में राजा का प्रासाद केंद्रबिदुं था। मनु ने सुझाया कि राजा को अपनी राजधानी इस प्रकार से बनवानी चाहिए जो कि सभी क्षेत्रो के देखरेख में समुचित व्यवस्था किया जा सके। कौटिल्य नगर नियोजन की अनेकानेक अवधारणाएं प्रस्तुत करते  हैं, नगर के सुदृढ़ भूमि भाग में राजभवनों का निर्माण कराना चाहिए। साथ ही यह भी ध्यान भी रखना चाहिए कि यह भूमि चारों वर्णों की आजीविका के लिए उपयोगी हों। गृह भूमि के बीच से उत्तर की ओर नवें हिस्से में अंतःपुर के पूर्वोत्तर भाग में आचार्य, पुरोहित के भवन, यज्ञशाला, जलाशय और मंत्रियों के भवन बवनाए जाएं। अंतःपुर के पूर्व दक्षिण  भाग में महानस , हस्तशाला और कोष्ठागार हो। उसके आगे पूरब दिशा में इत्र, तेल, पुष्पहार, अन्न, धी, तेल की दुकाने और प्रधान कारीगरों एवं क्षत्रियों के निवास स्थान होने चाहिए। दक्षिण पूरब में भंडागार, राजकीय पदार्थों के आय-व्यय का स्थान, और सोने चांदी की दुकाने होनी चाहिए। उससे आगे दक्षिण दिशा में नगराध्यक्ष , धान्याध्य़क्ष, खदानों तथा कारखानों के निरीक्षक, सेनाध्यक्ष, भोजनालाय, शराब एवं मांस की दुकाने, वेश्या, नट और वैश्य आदि के निवास स्थान होने चाहिए। पश्चिम-दक्षिण भाग में ऊंटो एवं गदहों के गुप्ति स्थान तथा उनके व्यापार के लिए एक अस्थाई घर बनवाया जाए। पश्चिम दिशा में ही एक ओर रथ तथा पालकी आदि सवारियों के रखने के स्थान होने चाहिए। उसके आगे चमड़े का काम करने वाले, हथियार और अंक म्यान बनाने वाले और शूद्र लोगों को बसाया

इसमें कोई शक नहीं कि तेजी से शहर तो बस जाते हैं लेकिन पर्यावरण, मानव जीवन का स्तर, रहन-सहन, आवास जैसी बुनियादी सुविधाएं कहीं शहरीकरण के सिमटते सामाजिक दायित्वबोध में पीछे छुट जाती है। कहीं न कहीं इन तमाम बिंदुओं का ख्याल रखते हुए जिस शहर का निर्माण किया जाए वह स्मार्ट शहर कहा जा सकता है। दुनिया के कई ऐसे शहर है जो इस मानदंडो को न सिर्फ पूरा करते हैं बल्कि खुद किसी खास प्रयोग की सफलता के लिए जाने भी जाते हैं। स्मार्ट सिटी के रूप में बसाए गए इन कुछ शहरों को उदाहरण के तौर पर रखकर इस बात का मूल्यांकन किया जा सकता है कि स्मार्ट सिटी हो तो कैसा हो? अभी हाल ही में प्रधानमंत्री ने संयुक्त अरब अमीरात  दौरा किया था। संयुक्त अरब अमीरात की राजधानी वाशिगटन से महज 6 किलोमीटर की दूरी पर शहर है मसदर। मसदर दुनिया का पहला  जीरो कार्बन शहर है। जीरो कार्बन शहर का आशय है कि उस बसावट से जिसमें यातायात से लेकर घरेलू रसोई तक में कार्बन को पूरी तरह से प्रतिबंधित किया हो और सुविधाओं के अन्य विकल्पों को विकसित कर लिया गया हो। इस लिहाज से देखा जाए तो मसदर तेजी से जीरो कार्बन शहर के रूप में विकसित हुआ है। मसदर में कार्बन उगलने वाली कार और गाड़ियां नहीं हैं। इस शहर में न तो कूड़ा है और न ही किसी तरह का धुआं। यहां बिना ड्रावइर की गाड़ियों में सैर की जा सकती है। इस शहर में ऊर्जा सिर्फ नवीकरणीय ऊर्जा स्रोतों से ली जा रही है. और इसके लिए 54 एकड़ में 88 हजार सौर पैनल लगाए गए है। पानी एवं घरेलु सुविधाओं के लिहाज से भी मसदर ने कई बेहतरीन प्रयोग किये हैं। मसदर को बिजली स्विच एवं घरेलू पानी सप्लाई को भी सेंसर्स तकनीक पर विकसित करने की दिशा में प्रयास किया गया है। प्राकृतिक हवाओं को कैसे ठंड़ी हवा के पूर में घरों तक पहुंचाया जाए इसका भी ख्याल विंड टॉवर के रूप में विकसित करके रखा गया है। प्रधानमंत्री ने वहां प्राइवेट रैपिड ट्रॉजिट व्यवस्था को देखते हुए कार्बन मुक्त कार का सफर भी किया। इस लिहाज से अगर देखा जाए तो संयुक्त अरब अमीरात ने पर्यावरण एवं रहन सहन के लिहाज से मसदर के रूप में एक स्मार्ट सिटी का निर्माण किया है। स्मार्ट सिटी के रूप में विकसित हो रहे शहरों की सूची में एक महत्वपूर्ण नाम दक्षिण कोरिया का सांगडो शहर है। इसे आधुनिक विश्व का पहला स्मार्ट शहर भी माना जाता है। आज से ठीक एक दशक पहले 2005 में समुद्री तट पर इस शहर को बसाने का काम शुरू हुआ था। इस शहर को बसाने का कुल बजट लगभग 35 बिलियन डालर आंका गया था। इस शहर की विशेषता ये है कि इसे पूरे शहर को एक सूचना प्रणाली से नियत्रित करने और जोड़कर रखने की दिशा में विकसित किया गया है। यह वजह है कि इसे बाद में बक्से में बंद शहर भी कहा जाने लगा। सान्गडो में सभी चीजों में इलेक्ट्रानिक सेंसर लगा हुआ है। मसलन अगर देखा जाए तो स्वाचलित सीढ़ियां, यानी एस्केलेटर, आदि सुविधा संसाधन तभी चलेंगे जब उन पर कोई खड़ा होगा। सभी घरों में टेलिप्रेजेंस सिस्टम लगाया गया है। तकनीक और सूचना प्रणाली के जरिए ही घर के ताले तक नियंत्रित होंगे। घर को गर्म रखने के लिये हीटिंग प्रणाली आदि सभी पर ई-नेटवर्क के जरिए कंट्रोल रखा जा सकता है। यहां तक की स्कूल, अस्पताल और दूसरे सरकारी दफ्तर भी नेटवर्क पर हैं। तकनीक की दृष्टि से ये शहर एक नजीर है। इस शहर को तकनीक सिस्को दे रही है और ये विकास के अपने अंतिम दौर में है। ऐसा अनुमान जताया गया है कि 65,000 लोग रह रहै है और 3,00,000 लोग अलग-अलग वजहों से इस शहर से जुड़े हुए है। स्मार्ट शहरो की अगर बात हो तो ब्राजील के चर्चित शहर रियो डे जेनेरो का नाम जरूर आता है। यह शहर आगामी 2016 में ओलंपिक की मेजबानी भी करने वाला है। ओलंपिक के लिहाज से इस शहर को स्मार्ट सिटी के रूप में स्थापित करने की तैयारी चल रही है। इस दिशा में काम बढ़ाते हुए वहां के कॉर्पोरेट एवं सरकार ने शहर की तीस एजेंसियों को एक नेटवर्क पर जोड़ने की दिशा में अनोखा कदम उठाया है जिससे किसी भी स्थिति से बेहतर तरीके से निपटा जा सके । सूचना एवं प्रौद्योगिकी कंपनी आईबीएम ने मौसम के पूर्वानुमान के लिए आधुनिक प्रणाली तैयार की है। एवं मौसम और ट्रैफिक आदि के लिए विशेष प्रकार के तकनीकी विकल्प विकसित किये गए है। हालांकि ऐसा बिलकुल भी नहीं है कि शहर को विकसित करने की दिशा में आम लोगों का सहयोग एवं सहभागिता नहीं ली जा रही है। इस शहर के आम लोगों में भी आवासीय विकास की दिशा में आदर्श रिहायश के तमाम विकल्पों पर काम कर चुके है। घरों के डिजाइन और उन्हें बनाने के आसान तरीके इंटरनेट परउपलब्ध कराये गए और लोगों ने इस काम में भरपूर सहयोग किया। इस लिहाज से अगर देखा जाए तो ब्राजील का यह शहर सरकार, कॉर्पोरेट एवं जनभागीदारी के आपसी सामंजस्य से स्थापित हो रहा एक बेहतरीन शहर है जहां उन तमाम बिंदुओं गौर किया गया है जो एक स्मार्ट सिटी के मूल मानदंड में जरूरी है। स्पेन का बार्सिलोना दुनिया के उन शहरों में शुमार है जो स्मार्ट मानदंडो को पूरा करते है। बार्सिलोना इस लिहाज से खास है क्योंकि वहां तकनीक को हर स्तर पर उपयोग किया जा रहा है। बार्सिलोना में कूड़ा उठाने से लगाए बसों के रूट आदि के सेंसर तकनीक से जोड़ने की दिशा में पहले हो चुकी है। बार्सिलोना को लेकर यह दावा किया जाता है कि यह दुनिया का सबसे आगे बढ़ चुका स्मार्ट शहर है। हालांकि ऐसा बिल्कुल नहीं है कि स्मार्ट सिटी की परिकल्पना केवल उन्ही शहरो तक सीमित हो सकती है जो नए बसाए जा रहे है इस मामले में फ्रांस के चर्चित शहर पेरिस को नजीर के तौर पर रखा चा सकता है।', 114),
(139, 2, '15', 'अतीत साक्षी है कि भारत में शहर  और गांवों का नियोजन कितना व्यवस्थित होता था। शहर और ग्रामों के व्यवस्थित नियोजन के ही कारण भारत के विकास के चरमोत्कर्ष तक पहुंच चुका था। नियोजकों ने मस्तिष्क में इन समस्त बातों का भरपूर ध्यान रखा था कि शहर और गांवो के मध्य संतुलन बना रहे। अव्यवस्थित विकास से यह व्यवस्था चरमरा न उठे। संस्कृत साहित्य में इन सभी बातों के पर्याप्त स्रोत उपलब्ध हैं। इस अध्याय में उन बिंदुओं पर चर्चा की जायेगी । शहर और गांवो के नियोजन के संबंध में चितंको ने भरपूर चिंतन किया था और  इस बात का ध्यना कर रखा था कि विकास के संदर्भ में गांव और शहरों के मध्य समन्वय बना रहे। इस हेतु उन्होंने उस समय की राजनीति सामाजिक एवं आर्थिक परिस्थितियों को ध्यान में रखा था। चिंतकों के ध्यान में यह विषय गंभीरता से बैठा हुआ था कि मनुष्य का सर्वागीण विकास तब तक संभव नहीं है। जब तक कि उसका सामाजिक और आर्थिक विकास न हो। इसलिए चिंतको ने नियोजन को राजधर्म माना। इलिए ही शासकों ने  ग्रामीण और शहरी विकास के माध्यम से नागरिकों को बेहतर जीवन प्रदान  करने का प्रयास किया इस संबंध में उन्हेोने यातायात, जनसंख्या एवं आवासीय विकास पर अत्यधिक बल दियाआधुनिक समय की तरह शहरी और ग्रामीण समस्याओं का सामना करना प्राचीन काल के नागरिकों को नही करना पड़ता था। नियोजन में तत्कालीन आवश्यकताओं को दृष्टिगत रखकर विकास का प्रारुप तैयार किया जाता था राज्यों के पास एक कार्यक्रम होता था जिसके माध्यम से वे शहर और गांवो में जनसंख्या स्थापना के कार्यों को अंजाम देते थे। मोहनजोदड़ो हड़प्पा, कालीबंगा एवं लोथल के खण्डहार अस बत के स्पष्ट प्रमाण है कि उस समय का नियोजन कितना स्पष्ट हुआ करता था। रामायण, महाभारत, अर्थशास्त्र एवं मनुस्मृति में वर्णित शहरों के वर्णन से उनके नियोजन, विकास एवं भव्यता का आंकलन सहजता से ही किया जा सकता है। उस समय के शहरों अयोध्या, लंका, पाटलिपुत्र, मगध, आदि के वर्णन से इस बात के प्रमाण मिल जाते है। कौटिल्य लिखते है कि राज्य की सीमा पर अंतफर नामक दुर्ग रक्षण के संरक्षण में एक दुर्ग की भी स्थापना करें। जनपद की सीमा पर अंतफल की अध्यक्षता में ही आधारभूत स्थानों का भी निर्माण करें। उनके भीतरी भागों की रक्षा व्याघ, शबरी, पुलिंद्र, चाण्डाल आदि वनचर जातियों के लोग करे। राजा को चाहिए कि ऋत्विक, आचार्य पुरोहित तथा श्रोत्रिय आदि ब्राह्मणों के लिए भूमिदान करें किंतु उनसे कर आदि न ले और उस भूमि को वापिस भी न ले। इसी प्रकार विभागीय अध्यक्षों, संख्याकों,  गोपों , वेद्यों  अश्वशिक्षको, कर्मचारियों और प्रजाजनों के लिए भी राजा भूमि दान करें। किंतु इस प्रकार पाई हुई जमीन को बेचने या गिरवी रखने के लिए वर्जित कर दें। कौटिल्य का मानना है कि सामाजिक सरोकारों की पूर्ति या तो राज्य कर या फिर समस्त समाज स्वयं करे, कोई भी इसमें से बचने का प्रयास करे तो समाज उसका प्रतिकार करे। राजा को चाहिए कि वह आकर (खान) से उत्पन्न सोना चांदी आदि के विक्रय स्थान, चंदन आदि के उत्तम काष्ठ के बाजार, हाथियों के जंगल, पशुओं की वृद्धि के स्थान, आयात-निर्यात के स्थान, जल-थल के कार्य और बड़े बड़े बाजारों या बड़ी-बड़ी मण्डियों की भी व्यवस्था करें। ऐसा करके राजा गांवों की अर्थ व्यवस्था में प्रभारी भूमिका निभा सकते है। प्राचीन भारत में शहरी नियोजन की व्यवस्था भी अद्भुत थी। प्रस्तुत अध्ययन में जो वर्णन किया जा रहा है, उससे यह प्रतीत होता है कि उस समय का  नियोजन कितना उच्च स्तर का था। रामायण लिखते हैं कि अयोध्या के चारों ओर गहरी खाई खुदी थी, जिसमें प्रवेश करना कठिन था या जिसे लाघंना अत्यंत कठिन था। वह नगरी दुसरों के लिए सर्वथा दुर्गम एवं दुर्जेय थी। घोंडे, हाथ, गाय, बैल, ऊंट, तथा गदहें आदि उपयोगी वस्तुओं से वह पूरी भरी पूरी थी। यानि यह नगर भी था और सुरक्षा की दृष्टि से किले का भी आकार लिए था। इस प्रकार का समन्वय विरले ही मिलता है। आगे लिखते है कि क्या तुम्हारे सभी दुर्ग धन धान्य , अस्त्र-शास्त्र, जल, यंत्र, शिल्पी तथा धनुर्धर सैनिकों से भरे-पुरे होते है। प्राचीन भारत में नगर नियोजन कुछ मूलभूत नियमों पर आधारित था जैसे कि  मुख्य मार्गों का नियमित विकास, शहर का उपविभाजन तथा सड़कों की चौड़ाई निर्धारित करना। शहर में मंदिर, मार्ग, पैदलपथ, बाजार, बाग, एवं मनोरंजन के विभिन्न स्थान निर्धारित थे तथा नगर में व्यवस्थित प्रवाह प्रणाली स्थापित करने के परिनियम निर्धारित किये गये थे। इसके अतिरिक्त अग्नि प्रज्वलन के कारण एवं उसके शमन पर भी व्यापक ऱू से विचार किया गया था। शहर को राजधानी के रूप में विकसित करने में राजा का प्रासाद केंद्रबिदुं था। मनु ने सुझाया कि राजा को अपनी राजधानी इस प्रकार से बनवानी चाहिए जो कि सभी क्षेत्रो के देखरेख में समुचित व्यवस्था किया जा सके। कौटिल्य नगर नियोजन की अनेकानेक अवधारणाएं प्रस्तुत करते  हैं, नगर के सुदृढ़ भूमि भाग में राजभवनों का निर्माण कराना चाहिए। साथ ही यह भी ध्यान भी रखना चाहिए कि यह भूमि चारों वर्णों की आजीविका के लिए उपयोगी हों। गृह भूमि के बीच से उत्तर की ओर नवें हिस्से में अंतःपुर के पूर्वोत्तर भाग में आचार्य, पुरोहित के भवन, यज्ञशाला, जलाशय और मंत्रियों के भवन बवनाए जाएं। अंतःपुर के पूर्व दक्षिण  भाग में महानस , हस्तशाला और कोष्ठागार हो। उसके आगे पूरब दिशा में इत्र, तेल, पुष्पहार, अन्न, धी, तेल की दुकाने और प्रधान कारीगरों एवं क्षत्रियों के निवास स्थान होने चाहिए। दक्षिण पूरब में भंडागार, राजकीय पदार्थों के आय-व्यय का स्थान, और सोने चांदी की दुकाने होनी चाहिए। उससे आगे दक्षिण दिशा में नगराध्यक्ष , धान्याध्य़क्ष, खदानों तथा कारखानों के निरीक्षक, सेनाध्यक्ष, भोजनालाय, शराब एवं मांस की दुकाने, वेश्या, नट और वैश्य आदि के निवास स्थान होने चाहिए। पश्चिम-दक्षिण भाग में ऊंटो एवं गदहों के गुप्ति स्थान तथा उनके व्यापार के लिए एक अस्थाई घर बनवाया जाए। पश्चिम दिशा में ही एक ओर रथ तथा पालकी आदि सवारियों के रखने के स्थान होने चाहिए। उसके आगे चमड़े का काम करने वाले, हथियार और अंक म्यान बनाने वाले और शूद्र लोगों को बसाया जाना चाहिए। उत्तर-पश्चिम में राजकीय पदार्थों को बेचने खरीदने का बाजार और औषधालाय लाने चाहिए। उत्तर-पश्चिम में कोष गृह और गाय बैल तथा घोड़ो के स्थान बनवाने चाहिए । उसके आगे , उत्तर दिशा की ओर नगर देवता, कुल देवता, लुहार, मनिहार और ब्राह्मणों के स्थान बनवाएं जाए। नगर के ओर-छोर जहां खाली जगह छुटी है, धोबी, दर्जी, जुलाहे और विदेशी व्यापारियों को बसाया जाये। ', 114),

Therefore the choice of a right is one of the most difficult tasks which a child faces today earlier Indian children had only a few choiced like medicine, teaching services etc. but now number of new industries have emerged. These attract children are in media, food hospital fashion and profession requires some specific skill talent and in some fields due to all these reasons choosing a right a very careful needs not only a child but parents in this regard Indian children are lucky enough because most of the parents take care of the child. There are many people in the world who are doing work for which they are not fit this causes and depression in them. Therefore well planning is very necessary in achieving a definite goal. Then we should assess our skills knowledge and other required for example if person doesn’t have interest in books studies updating and skill he should not think of voice can choose singing as his profession and so on it all self because talents and qualities differ from person to person find themselves suitable in the field of science while others are in industry. \r\n     Thus it is very wise to choose a career or profession with great care careful planning can make us success in our career.

Therefore the choice of a right is one of the most difficult tasks which a child faces today earlier Indian children had only a few choiced like medicine, teaching services etc. but now number of new industries have emerged. These attract children are in media, food hospital fashion and profession requires some specific skill talent and in some fields due to all these reasons choosing a right a very careful needs not only a child but parents in this regard Indian children are lucky enough because most of the parents take care of the child. There are many people in the world who are doing work for which they are not fit this causes and depression in them. Therefore well planning is very necessary in achieving a definite goal. Then we should assess our skills knowledge and other required for example if person doesn’t have interest in books studies updating and skill he should not think of voice can choose singing as his profession and so on it all self because talents and qualities differ from person to person find themselves suitable in the field of science while others are in industry. \r\n     Thus it is very wise to choose a career or profession with great care careful planning can make us success in our career.

The mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes the throne monarch better than his crown; His scepter shows the force of temporal power, Here is a letter read it at your leisure; It come from Padua, from Bellario There you shall find that Portiaa was the doctor, shall witness I set forth as soon as you and even but now returned I have not yet Entered my house Antonio, you are welcome Than you expect; unseal this letter soon; are richly come to harbor suddenly; You shall not know by what strange accident I chanced on this letter.\r\nThis book is meant for non detailed study the purpose of it is to develop in the students the ability to read with speed without going into those details which are not very crucial to the main theme of the story Hence, each and every difficult word need not be explained. It is sufficient if the reader understands some of the words vaguely and yet does not stop reading. In this way as the student advances, his range of vocabulary expands. The more he reads, the more enriched his teacher should refrain from reading the story aloud in the class. Reading aloud is not required even in a lesson meant for detailed study. It is much less so in the case of non detailed study. The students must be encouraged to read silently and fast. However, if should be borne in mind that speed should not be overemphasized at the cost of pleasure.\r\nThe teacher may introduce the story by telling a little about the writer, drawing attention to the title, telling a little of the story and establishing the setting time place, characters then letting them read on and ask questions referring to the glosses when necessary. At times the students may be asked to guess the subsequent events and find out whether their guess  is right or wrong. This is one of the ways to motivate the students to read. Comprehension questions under A are intended to assist the students in reading and understanding the car can lend three thousand ducats or shall I bend low and in a bond man key with bated breath and whispering humble say this fair sir you spit on me on Wednesday last; you spurn me such a day; another time you call do me dog and for these courtesies I will lend and thus much moneys I am as like to call three so gain to spurn three too if thou wilt lend this money lend it not as to thy friends for when did friend ship take a breed for barren metal of his friends but lend it rather to thine enemy who if he break thou mayst with better face Exact the Penalty.\r\nWhy look you how you storm I would be friends with you and have your love, forget the shames that you have stain did me with supply your present wants and take no doit or usance for my moneys and you will and you not hear me this is kind I offer.

Therefore the choice of a right is one of the most difficult tasks which a child faces today earlier Indian children had only a few choiced like medicine, teaching services etc. but now number of new industries have emerged. These attract children are in media, food hospital fashion and profession requires some specific skill talent and in some fields due to all these reasons choosing a right a very careful needs not only a child but parents in this regard Indian children are lucky enough because most of the parents take care of the child. There are many people in the world who are doing work for which they are not fit this causes and depression in them. Therefore well planning is very necessary in achieving a definite goal. Then we should assess our skills knowledge and other required for example if person doesn’t have interest in books studies updating and skill he should not think of voice can choose singing as his profession and so on it all self because talents and qualities differ from person to person find themselves suitable in the field of science while others are in industry. \r\n     Thus it is very wise to choose a career or profession with great care careful planning can make us success in our career.

It would not be wrong to say that the words and politics have became to each other in India.

The mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes the throne monarch better than his crown; His scepter shows the force of temporal power, Here is a letter read it at your leisure; It come from Padua, from Bellario There you shall find that Portiaa was the doctor, shall witness I set forth as soon as you and even but now returned I have not yet Entered my house Antonio, you are welcome Than you expect; unseal this letter soon; are richly come to harbor suddenly; You shall not know by what strange accident I chanced on this letter.\r\nThis book is meant for non detailed study the purpose of it is to develop in the students the ability to read with speed without going into those details which are not very crucial to the main theme of the story Hence, each and every difficult word need not be explained. It is sufficient if the reader understands some of the words vaguely and yet does not stop reading. In this way as the student advances, his range of vocabulary expands. The more he reads, the more enriched his teacher should refrain from reading the story aloud in the class. Reading aloud is not required even in a lesson meant for detailed study. It is much less so in the case of non detailed study. The students must be encouraged to read silently and fast. However, if should be borne in mind that speed should not be overemphasized at the cost of pleasure.\r\nThe teacher may introduce the story by telling a little about the writer, drawing attention to the title, telling a little of the story and establishing the setting time place, characters then letting them read on and ask questions referring to the glosses when necessary. At times the students may be asked to guess the subsequent events and find out whether their guess  is right or wrong. This is one of the ways to motivate the students to read. Comprehension questions under A are intended to assist the students in reading and understanding the car can lend three thousand ducats or shall I bend low and in a bond man key with bated breath and whispering humble say this fair sir you spit on me on Wednesday last; you spurn me such a day; another time you call do me dog and for these courtesies I will lend and thus much moneys I am as like to call three so gain to spurn three too if thou wilt lend this money lend it not as to thy friends for when did friend ship take a breed for barren metal of his friends but lend it rather to thine enemy who if he break thou mayst with better face Exact the Penalty.\r\nWhy look you how you storm I would be friends with you and have your love, forget the shames that you have stain did me with supply your present wants and take no doit or usance for my moneys and you will and you not hear me this is kind I offer.

Even for that I thank you; therefore, I prey you, lead me to the caskets to try my fortune. But it is scimitar that slew the try my fortune. By scimitar that slew three fields of Sultan Solyman.

But alas the while if hear and lichas play at dice which is the better man the greater throw may turn by fortune from the weaker hand so is a ladies beaten by his page; and so may I blind fortune leading me miss that which one their may be attain and die with grieving you must take your chance and either not attempt to choose at all or swear before you choose, if you choose wrong never to speak to lady afterward in way of marriage therefore be advised nor will not \r\n', 123),

It led to heavy floods near kedar dome and a distruct it caused at many places in the state country worst natural disaster since the sunami\r\nThe disaster caused a huge loss of life and property as per the state figures on of july more than 5 people were presumed dead many houses and several villages and such as ram bara, transition point to were market town of suffered a heavy damage and loss of lives the base of the temple was with water, mud and boulders due to the landslide the temple area got though the main temple of was not damaged but it was flood with water inside this temple caused many deaths due to drowning. Many hotels, rest houses and shops in got badly damaged most of the was caused by a sudden and rapid melting of ice on the which from temple the heavy rains resulted in a sudden flood and massive landslide. Over people were struck in several regions because of damaged or blocked roads. People in the valley of were aloof for several days which  the region, was also washed away near and at many other places for more than three days pilgrims and tourists remained without rations and survived very heard on the little food left. The roads were seriously damaged at more than places it led heavy traffic jams. On the of June more than pilgrims were stranded at the Yatra covering and was cancelled by the State. Thousands of people were left separated in the villages the army, air Force border police border disaster force operations. I am social were involved in rescue and relief centres were used to rescue people. Due to heavy fog rainfall rescue operation was a challenge by June the Army had deployed soldiers from airlifted about people it also dropped landed huge quantity worked together for quick rescue social organizations were also involved in rescue and of relied centres were used to rescue people rescue from crashed it was carrying Force officers of the and personnel it crashed mountain slope near gauri Kund, killing all on board. The disaster left sings of havoc everywhere in the valley. It ruined many families. Rapidly that people could not do anything to save their lives to some extent man is also number of casualty and reached higher because of the resorts and the hotels built on fragile river banks. Our neglecting attitude or anti-nature activities are also responsible factors for making natural more fatal. In the olden days choosing a profession was a cause of worry. In those days children used to adopt their parent or grand parents profession a farmer son became a farmer a potter son a potter making  king and but now in modern societies choosing a become a cause of worry now it requires planning it has become the thing of the past when caste or community of a person decided his at present it is the knowledge and the skill which decides what to choose. Therefore the choice of a right is one of the most difficult tasks which a child faces today earlier Indian children had only a few choiced like medicine, teaching services etc. but now number of new industries have emerged. These attract children are in media, food hospital fashion and profession requires some specific skill talent and in some fields due to all these reasons choosing a right a very careful needs not only a child but parents in this regard Indian children are lucky enough because most of the parents take care of the child. There are many people in the world who are doing work for which they are not fit this causes and depression in them. Therefore well planning is very necessary in achieving a definite goal. Then we should assess our skills knowledge and other required for example if person doesn’t have interest in books studies updating and skill he should not think of voice can choose singing as his profession and so on it all self because talents and qualities differ from person to person find themselves suitable in the field of science while others are in industry. \r\n     Thus it is very wise to choose a career or profession with great care careful planning can make us success in our career. On the other hand just copying others can spoil our life one can also take the help of career counselors to solve this problem. The career counselor with the child and finds out his interest, and makes of his skills and potential in a country like India just hand coping others becomes more tough a task. In India there are so many problems like poverty shortage of good so even after choosing a right career it is very genius either rot in clerical jobs due to or are semi employed. India is the largest country in the world there are clearly defined areas of and way the picture of Indian is changing is a matter of serious concern. It would not be wrong to say that the words and politics have became to each other in India. Leaving aside a few have made a fun of regional parties, there are many parties in India but except a few all are alike so people have no option but to elect the bad one thus one by one all the parties are befooling the public. By making false promises to the public they get success to come into the power. India is a country but in fact its and have shattered the soul of its has now settled in almost every corner of vast and found to be involved in criminal cases also. In some of the fields the is serious that it is next pay bribe, he is to take rounds from table to table. So to avoid wastage of  mental and physical stress, on is compelled to pay bribe by paying money anything fair or foul is possible in India if scams are named, there would be long list of we see that our diploma ninety marks an person is even for the lowest position while those who are not eligible are enjoying the topmost every where why this is all due to corruption. Unity is strength and is weakness a united group of people can always achieve more things than a single man. Unity makes the path of success easier. This is the reason why groups are formed in all walks of life. On the basis of our experience we have realized that by forming unions we can demand and achieve things in a stronger way. \r\n\r\n', 123),

But they count not succeed due to Once upon a time, Mahemood Ghagnave with his chiefs was sitting in a village near Delhi. The village was deserted. People had left with their things many ago. Finding no man or animal there Mahmood was much surprised. After a while hr sighted a pair of owls. They were sitting on a rein and appeared talking With each other.

Many people would be getting motivated by Kovind. Their self respect would have gone up. This is a great achievement for the demo how sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank here will we sit and let the sounds of music here will we sit and let the sounds of music creep in our ears soft stillness and the night become the touches of sweet harmony. Sit. Jessica look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with pat of bright gold there is not the smallest orb which thou behold is but in his motion but like an angel signs, still quering to the young eyed cherubins. Such harmony is in immoratal sound; but whilst this muddy vesture of decay doth grossly close it in we cannot hear I a never merry when I hear sweet music. The reason is your spirits are attentive: For do but note a wild and wanton herd, Or race of youthful and unhandled colts, Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud, Which is the hot condition of their blood; If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound, Or any air of music touch their ears, You shall perceive them make a mutual stand, Their savage eyes turned to a modest gaze By the sweet power of music: therefore the poet Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones and floods; Since thought so stock, hard and full of rage, But music for the time doth change his nature. Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds, Is fit for treasons, stratagems and spoils; The motions of his spirit are dull as night And his affections dark as Erebus: That light we see is burning in my hall. How far that little candle throws his beams! So shines a good deed in a naughty world. When the moon shone, we did not see the candle. So doth the greater glory dim the less: A substitute shines brightly as a king Unto the king be by, and then his state Empties itself, as doth an inland brook Into the main of waters. Music! Hark! It is your music, madam, of the house. Nothing is good, I see, without respect: Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day. Silence bestows that virtue on it, madam. The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark, When neither is attended, and I think the nightingale, if she should sing by day, When every goose is cackling, would be thought No better a musician than the wren. How many things and true perfection! Peace, ho  the moon sleep with Endymion And would not be awaked. That is the voice, Or I am much deceived, or Portia. He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo, By the bad voice. Dear lady, welcome home. We have been praying for our husbands’ health, Which speed, we hope, the better for our word. Are they returned? Madam, they are not yet; But there is come a messenger before, To signify their coming. Go in, Never Give order to my servants that they take NO note at all of our being absent hence Nor you Jessica, nor you. Your husband is at hand I hear his trumpet: We are no tell-tales, madam; fear you not. This night methinks is but the daylight sick; It looks a little paler this a day, Such as the day is when the sun is hid. We should hold day with the Antipodes, If you would walk in absence of the sun.

Sir, you are very welcome to our house: It must appear in other ways than words, Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy. By younger moon I swear you do me wrong; In faith, I gave it to the judge’s clerk: Would he were get that had it for my part, Since you do take it, love, so much at heart. A quarrel, ho, already What’s the matter? About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring That she did give me, whose posy was For all the world like cutler’s poetry Upon a knife, ‘Love me, and leave me not.’ What talk you of the posy or the value?

You pleased you in the same way. Why should I give you did you give me anything but words for which you expect con from me the poor poet could say nothing he picked up his stick and left for his home. Since that day, he ceased praising others in his verses.

People ate little but were happy today there are a lot of pleasures and comforts yet prevails everywhere in the country. We have two main problems increasing and riots we have to solve them until every man of the makes effort for it these cannot be solved.

But when he appealed to the pot full of ghee or bear hundred whips. “At this the merchant can escape from both punishments by giving a fine of one thousand would pay the fine happily  but he could the drink only half of the ghee. Then he killed to like to have whips, But after fifty whips he could not bear at all. At least he paid the full fine.  Gandhiji had no interest in physical exercise in the life.

Shortage of rain adversely affects the agriculture. It starts raining as the month of july starts begin. When the sky starts raining as the month of july starts gegin. When the sky is overcast with clouds. The weather becomes very pleasant . Greenery in sun all sound everywhere. New zeal. It gets dense dark at night. The light of moths allure attract the hearts of children. To imagine human life without water is impossible. \r\nIndia is a great nation country. It’s past has been very glorious. Foreign. Invaders tried attempts to plunder this country. They tried to destroy its culture and science and knowledge learning. But they count not succeed due to Once upon a time, Mahemood Ghagnave with his chiefs was sitting in a village near Delhi. The village was deserted. People had left with their things many ago. Finding no man or animal there Mahmood was much surprised. After a while hr sighted a pair of owls. They were sitting on a rein and appeared talking With each other. Mahmood looked at has minister and said. Didn’t you tell me a year ago that you understand the cries of birds What are these owls talking about The minister replied. One of these owls in talking about  The minister replied. one of these owls is lord and The young owl is saying in reply, by The grace of Mahmood Ghaznavi I can give you one thousand deserted villages in dowry. Mahmood was much grieved to hear this and left the place at one. \r\nIf a person has the will power to do extraordinary thing and he is read the to work hard then he can reach If a person has the will power to do extraordinary things and he is ready to work hard then he can reach pinnacle, the life of Ramnath Kovind is its example, On seeing him  the deprived section of the society would be feeling blessed . Many people would be getting motivated by Kovind. Their self respect would have gone up. This is a great achievement for the demo how sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank here will we sit and let the sounds of music here will we sit and let the sounds of music creep in our ears soft stillness and the night become the touches of sweet harmony. Sit. Jessica look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with pat of bright gold there is not the smallest orb which thou behold is but in his motion but like an angel signs, still quering to the young eyed cherubins. Such harmony is in immoratal sound; but whilst this muddy vesture of decay doth grossly close it in we cannot hear I a never merry when I hear sweet music. The reason is your spirits are attentive: For do but note a wild and wanton herd, Or race of youthful and unhandled colts, Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud, Which is the hot condition of their blood; If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound, Or any air of music touch their ears, You shall perceive them make a mutual stand, Their savage eyes turned to a modest gaze By the sweet power of music: therefore the poet Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones and floods; Since thought so stock, hard and full of rage, But music for the time doth change his nature. Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds, Is fit for treasons, stratagems and spoils; The motions of his spirit are dull as night And his affections dark as Erebus: That light we see is burning in my hall. How far that little candle throws his beams! So shines a good deed in a naughty world. When the moon shone, we did not see the candle. So doth the greater glory dim the less: A substitute shines brightly as a king Unto the king be by, and then his state Empties itself, as doth an inland brook Into the main of waters. Music! Hark! It is your music, madam, of the house. Nothing is good, I see, without respect: Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day. Silence bestows that virtue on it, madam. The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark, When neither is attended, and I think the nightingale, if she should sing by day, When every goose is cackling, would be thought No better a musician than the wren. How many things and true perfection! Peace, ho  the moon sleep with Endymion And would not be awaked. That is the voice, Or I am much deceived, or Portia. He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo, By the bad voice. Dear lady, welcome home. We have been praying for our husbands’ health, Which speed, we hope, the better for our word. Are they returned? Madam, they are not yet; But there is come a messenger before, To signify their coming. Go in, Never Give order to my servants that they take NO note at all of our being absent hence Nor you Jessica, nor you. Your husband is at hand I hear his trumpet: We are no tell-tales, madam; fear you not. This night methinks is but the daylight sick; It looks a little paler this a day, Such as the day is when the sun is hid. We should hold day with the Antipodes, If you would walk in absence of the sun. Let me give light wife doth make a heavy husband, And never be so for me: But God sort all You are welcome home, my lord. I thank you , madam. Give welcome to my friend. This is the man, this is Antonio, to whom I am so infinitely bound. You should in all sense be much boud to him. For, as I hear, he was much bound for you. No more than I am well acquitted of. Sir, you are very welcome to our house: It must appear in other ways than words, Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy. By younger moon I swear you do me wrong; In faith, I gave it to the judge’s clerk: Would he were get that had it for my part, Since you do take it, love, so much at heart. A quarrel, ho, already What’s the matter? About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring That she did give me, whose posy was For all the world like cutler’s poetry Upon a knife, ‘Love me, and leave me not.’ What talk you of the posy or the value? You swore to me, when I did give it you, That you would wear it ', 125),
